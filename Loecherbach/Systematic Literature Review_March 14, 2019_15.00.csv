Shannon’s H is based on the distribution of observations across a given number of distinct object categories, weighted by the occurrence of these object categories (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015). In our case, entropy (H) is the negative sum for all firm types of the likelihood p(x) that a firm type x is allocated to a specific industry segment i, multiplied by the natural logarithm of that likelihood (Jennings et al., 2011). As ln(0) is undefined, we replaced the zero with a very small proportion: 0.0000001. This is common procedure in agendasetting research (Boydstun et al., 2014a). While the minimum score of Shannon’s H is always equal to zero (complete focus of attention on one category), the maximum score is dependent on the amount of categories.

Beyond these three layers it is worth introducing a fourth layer: the user level. Others have called this exposure diversity,38 or as Peggy Valcke formulated the three levels: pluralism of supply, distribution and use.39

ideology (Gentzkow and Shapiro 2011; Bakshy, Messing, and Adamic 2015; Flaxman,
Goel, and Rao 2016). Under this approach, the political preferences of the source’s audience
are used to estimate its “ideology” or “slant.” This is not a “content-based” measure
of ideology, but the two approaches have been shown to produce similar results
(Flaxman, Goel, and Rao 2016).
To code each source, we first computed the average political leaning of the
population of each country by asking all survey respondents to place themselves on a
seven-point scale ranging from “very left-wing” to “very right-wing,” with “centre” as
the mid-point. To make responses from different countries more comparable, we
reduced this to a three-point scale, with left-leaning responses coded -.5, right-leaning
responses .5, and centre as 0. Then, the same process was repeated to produce the
average political leaning of the audience for each news source. Sources with a “lower”
average political leaning than the mean of the population were coded as left-leaning,
and those with a higher figure right-leaning.

Republican Party candidate Donald Trump (conservative) or Democratic Party candidate
Hillary Clinton (liberal) determined which type of news use was coded as pro-attitudinal
(Mw1 = 1.62, SDw1 = 1.41, Mw2 = 1.61, SDw2 = 1.39, Mw3 = 1.68, SDw3 = 1.45) or counterattitudinal
(Mw1 = .86, SDw1 = 1.08, Mw2 = .83, SDw2 = 1.09, Mw3 = .84, SDw3 = 1.04). Participants
who did not indicate a candidate preference were excluded from this analysis

Napoli, 2015; Van Cuilenburg (1999); Karppinen, 2013; Karppinen, 2015; Pariser, 2011","Whereas diversity in the social scientific debate is often conceptualized
as inclusion of counter-attitudinal information (Pariser, 2011), in computer science it is
considered a necessary design element, often conceptualized as the inclusion of unexpected
items. Diversity is mostly modeled and conceptualized at the input level in computer
science, whereas social scientists analyze diversity primarily at the output level:
Whereas the former study how to optimize the inclusion of surprising or unexpected
items, social scientists focus on the overall output of a recommender system and assess
its diversity (Sørensen & Schmidt, 2016).

In reality, news content diversity is a far richer, and far more complex phenomenon
(see, e.g. Helberger et al., 2018; Sørensen & Schmidt, 2016; Masini et al., 2017;
Napoli, 2015). As Van Cuilenburg (1999) puts it, diversity defines the ‘heterogeneity
of media content in terms of one or more specified characteristics’ (p. 188). In the
context of media policy, diversity is often defined and measured as diversity of
sources in a media market (e.g. The Media Pluralism Monitor in Europe or the
FTC’s controversial Diversity Index; Napoli, 2015; Karppinen, 2013).

More practically, most of the existing approaches
look at media markets in their entirety (external diversity) (Karppinen, 2015), and
less at the diversity within a particular outlet (internal diversity). Obviously, assessing
the diversity of the results of personalized recommendations requires an assessment
at the (internal) level of the recommendation, or respectively the output of a
personalized recommendation1.",Yes,"One media outlet (i.e. one newspaper, one TV channel, one social media platform)",,"Exposure perspective (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} consumed by the audience, i.e. what they read, view, click on; more focussed on what is displayed to the individual)",,Related to topics (e.g. sports or politics or economics),,,diversity of topics,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,Newspaper (online),,Yes,Related to topics (e.g. sports or politics or economics),,,,,,,Simulation Study,,Yes,No,,,,,,,Yes - look up the source in the references and copy the doi (or other identifying information if not present) here,"Ricotta & Szeidl, 2006; ",Yes - Copy the formula (including explanation of the variables) or the description of the mathematical procedure here,Rao's quadratic entropy; Shannon entropy (formulas on page 967),No,,"As a result, each topic can be represented by its coordinates
(x,y)in a two-dimensional space. As the Euclidian distance between two points is, and as each document D is represented by a vector wD of 50 topic weights wD,1 · · · wD,50, we can calculate the topic distance between two documents.

Another more recent approach is the use of word embeddings to capture the aggregate
inter-document difference, basically by considering the Wasserstein metric describing
the minimum effort to make two documents similar. This is called the word mover distance
(WMD). The great benefit of this method is that it is not sensitive to non-overlapping
document vocabularies. We use a word vector model pre-trained on the NLCOW14
corpus (see Tulkens et al., 2016; Schäfer & Bildhauer, 2012), which we again apply using
Gensim.

We estimated the polarity and subjectivity of the articles using the package Pattern. Using these tuples as coordinates, we can situate each article in a two-dimensional sentiment
space.

Having obtained the pairwise distances, we will describe their distributions per recommender
system.
Additionally, we can apply formal diversity measures such as Rao’s quadratic entropy/
diversity (see Ricotta & Szeidl, 2006)

We calculate Rao’s quadratic entropy based on the main section titles, as they are
readily available and unambiguous for the distance we use, which is the cosine similarity
of the word vectors for these section titles. As we are interested in diversity, not from the
perspective of maintainable diverse species but rather from the perspective of a diverse
representation of available categories we replace the proportions pi and pj by (1 − pi)n
and (1 − pj)n respectively to create slightly adapted diversity measures. This ensures
that the inclusion of niche categories contribute the most to the final diversity. In the standard
formulation categories with larger proportions contribute more to the diversity.
We additionally report the Shannon entropy

It is important to note that both Rao’s quadratic entropy and Shannon’s entropy will
give high indications of diversity even if small niche categories are severely underrepresented
or even omitted.

are based on five-category Likert scales; so they measure the extent to which a respondent
reports being in an echo chamber. For the first three items, the stub was ‘When looking for
news or political information, how often, if ever, do you… ’. Each of the following four
items follow that stub and are used as dependent variables. They are
(1) ‘Read something you DISAGREE with?’ (which we call ‘Disagree’);
(2) ‘Check a news source that’s different from what you normally read?’ (which we call
‘Different’);
(3) ‘Try to confirm political information you found by searching online for another
source?’ (which we call ‘Confirm’).
(4) ‘Try to confirm political information by checking a major offline news medium?’
(which we call ‘Offline’)
The fifth dependent variable, which we call ‘Changed’, is about opinion change:
(5) ‘Thinking about recent searches you have done online using a search engine, how
often have you discovered something that CHANGED your opinion on a political
issue?

All dependent variables are coded so that lower values mean the respondent is more
likely to be in an echo chamber. This coding implies that, in the regressions, negative coefficients
of the independent variables mean a respondent is more likely to be in an echo
chamber; positive coefficients mean they are less likely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Media diversity,"Social media diversity ",political interest,political participation,"demographics (age, gender, employment, education)",Regression,,Yes,,Negative influence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Regression,,Yes,,Negative influence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Regression,,Yes,,Negative influence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Regression,,"Other (not mentioned or qualitative study, please fill in how the authors judge the influence)","Mixed (for some dimensions, for others not)",Negative influence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Regression,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Here, diversity is used as independent and echo chamber as dependent variable (but only survey measures, content was not examined)"

First, diversity can aim at a multitude of sources. Such source diversity describes the pluralism
of quoted actors’ affiliations or status positions

Yet, source diversity may also depict the variety of news outlets
which are included in a recipient’s news diet, especially in the context of news aggregators
(Thurman 2011). Second, diversity can refer to the variety of covered topics. This
so-called content diversity oftentimes relates to the mere appearance of topics in their
most basic form, such as “public affairs” or “baseball.” Yet, it may also include the multitude
of perspectives, which ideally represent a democracy’s political spectrum of opinions
(Entman and Wildman 1992).

Third, diversity can relate to a variation of
viewpoints (i.e., framing). This viewpoint diversity subsumes available frames on a given
topic and is thus clearly the most demanding type of diversity, both for journalists to produce

As we discuss below, there is no commonly accepted definition of exposure diversity or the possible policy objectives behind it, even in aca- demic literature.

Any initiative to promote more diverse exposure to information will first have to deal with the question of what ‘diverse exposure’ actually is. In debates on media diversity, exposure diversity is used to refer to the content that the audience actually selects, as opposed to all the content that is available (McQuail, 1992)

discussions around media diversity have tended to focus primarily on the supply side (the aspects of source and content diversity) and questions of what would characterize a diverse market structure or diverse content offers (Helberger, 2012; Napoli, 1999; Valcke, 2011)

Despite decades of debate on diver- sity as a policy objective, however, there is no consensus on a generally accepted, consist- ent definition of what constitutes ‘diversity’ or ‘pluralism’, even at the level of supply (Karppinen, 2013; Napoli, 1999; Neuberger & Lobgis, 2010; Valcke, 2004)

Firstly, exposure diversity can be defended from the perspective of the traditional liberal ideals of individual autonomy and consumer choice. The possible benchmarks and criteria used to identify the desirable level and form of exposure diversity would thus include aspects such as user satisfaction and awareness of options and choices.

Secondly, exposure to diverse information is commonly justified from the perspective of inclusive public debate. Possible benchmarks and criteria to assess exposure diversity from the deliberative perspective include the reciprocity and inclusive- ness of public discourse – meaning that debates should be open to all and participants should be willing to exchange ideas and viewpoints, and even change their opinion when faced with new arguments or evidence

Thirdly, exposure diversity can also be justified from the perspective of more radical agon- istic or adversarial conceptions of democracy. Exposure diversity can be seen as a corrective to the tendency of public debates to be dominated by existing elites and powerful interests. This is achieved particularly by con- testing the boundaries of mainstream public debate and promoting exposure to critical voices and disadvantaged views that otherwise might be silenced in the public debate (see e.g., Young, 2000)

the modern challenges to the realization of media diversity as a policy goal lie less and less in guaranteeing a diversity of supply, and more in the quest to create the conditions under which users can actually find and choose between diverse content (Burri, 2016; Helberger, 2012; Korthals, 2013, p. 35).

However, these recent discussions again lack a clear normative conception of exposure diversity. Accordingly, acknowledging the need for such a normative discussion to inform not only law and policy-makers but also designers could be the first step.

In recent decades, a number of researchers have performed different studies with respect to serendipity, although these researchers have not reached a consensus on the definition of serendipity. For example, van Andel (1994) defines serendipity as “the art of making an unsought finding”, while Fine and Deegan (1996) give the definition of serendipity as “the unique and contingent mix of insight coupled with chance”. More recently, McCay-Peet and Toms (2015) contend that serendipity is “an unexpected experience prompted by an individual’s valuable interaction with ideas, information, objects, or phenomena”, while the term serendipity is defined in Björneborn’s (2017) paper as “what happens when we, in unplanned ways, encounter resources (information, things, people, etc.) that we find interesting”. Rather than giving a definition, Makri and Blandford (2012a) identified three key elements for serendipitous encountering: unexpectedness, insight and value.

First, we presented the definition of serendipity from the Oxford Concise English Dictionary: “the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way”",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data collection via social media platform, but the platform or the media were not studied; nevertheless good for getting an overview of what serendipity means (although not in the media context)"

At the same time, it is not possible to determine an ideal score of perfect pluralism. As pluralism is not a value in itself (‘the more, the merrier’), it is restricted to (what is deemed to be) legitimate ideas presented in an accepted manner with reasonable arguments.

In this context, Valcke, Picard and Sükösd (2015) dif- ferentiate between external pluralism, the plurality of media outlets and media ownership, and internal plu- ralism, the plurality of opinions in actual reporting. As the authors highlight, although the conditions of external pluralism ‘increase the possibility of achieving the objec- tives of pluralism, they do not guarantee it because they are not necessary and sufficient conditions for its exis- tence’ (Valcke et al., 2015, p. 2). Nevertheless, attempts to measure media pluralism focus on external pluralism, not only because it is easier to measure, but also because policy measures to improve—or in the case of authoritar- ian regimes, restrict—media pluralism are foremost di- rected at external pluralism (cf. e.g., Aslama et al., 2007; Picard, 2000).

In order to measure internal pluralism, this analysis refers to ‘sources’ (i.e., various political and ideological groups) as well as ‘opinions’ (i.e., various viewpoints and interests). The first aspect indicates the variety of people or institutions being quoted by journalists. The key ques- tion concerning ‘limited pluralism’ here is to what extent voices not belonging to the ruling elites are being quoted and which voices in particular. The second aspect indi- cates a variety of opinions (independently of the author).

Data Eng., vol. 24, no. 5, pp. 896–911, 2012.","The most accurate recommendations for a user are often too similar to each other, and attention has to be paid towards the goal of improving diversity in recommended items, known as individual di- versity [2]. Indeed, a recent user study pointed out a strong correlation between perceived accuracy and user satisfaction for approaches able to better diversify the returned list of recommended items [3]. While this kind of dimension is list-wise, since it represents the diversity degree in the recommendations list, the importance of a system-wise diversity has been revealed from other studies [4]. In particular, aggregate diversity has been proposed to assess the ability of a system to cover the items catalog, and equally distribute the recommendations across all the items.

Specifically, we use an intent-aware metric called BinomDiv [35] which measures the individual diversity also according to the user interests covered in the recommendation list. The latter is a system-wise property that measures the coverage of the items catalog and the distribution of the items across the users. We thus considered two metrics: catalog coverage (percentage of items recommended at least to once) and Entropy to analyze the items distribution [4].

Therefore, cultural and media policies cannot be separated because the basic principle of both still is the diversity of sources of information, of media ownership and of the independence of public service.

Will digital media be different from classic media regarding cultural diversity (using the concept in a broad sense) on the cultural, socio-economic and political spectrum? More specifically, in the context of the diversity of voices in the network, of political diversity and “polarisation”

Recognizing its importance, Napoli (1999) divided diversity into 1) source diversity, 2) content diversity, and 3) exposure diversity.  Citizens are free to choose from a wide range of ideas (content diversity), delivered from a wide range of sources (source diversity).

neutral shows. Each show’s political orientation was evaluated based on the general

Here we wanted to know what types of news were most
shared internationally, as a way of gauging media diversity, and to reassess research
that suggest audiences prefer soft, celebrity, sport and lifestyle-oriented content
(Boczkowski and Peer 2011).

This statement triggers many questions about how we
might then analyse the diversity of any one media system; about measuring, for example,
representation, access, available content choices and impact for audiences.

licensing and analysing “raw” social media-sharing data, they could conceivably calculate
risks to pluralism in terms of:
1. Availability (or in MPM terms “supply” or “distribution”), based on which news providers
are most or least shared.
2. Consumption (or in the MPM “use”), based on where audiences are accessing news
stories, including the reach of different platforms’ offerings; their relative share of
consumption, and the extent of user multi-sourcing across platforms.
3. Impact or influence—based on its level of recirculation, social velocity, geographic
spread, presence of commendations and comments.

They suggest that future policy assessments
for digital media pluralism need to be equipped to identify:
• The range of independent media voices.
• The reach and share of those voices across demographics.

a spectrum that ranges from “fragmented” to “duplicated.” One determines this
characterization by measuring the degree of audience “overlap” between each pair
of outlets within the environment, which is simply the proportion of the population

pluralism involves diversity in media supply, distribution and use. It is
intent on ensuring the presence of and access to a variety of information
sources, opinions and expressions, and cultural products that represent
the breadth and depth of society.

The initial measures of pluralism were developed to support competition
law analysis, first in the United States and then in Europe. These
included concentration ratios and the Herfindahl Index (also called
the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index). The focus of those measurements
on competition enforcement later led to the introduction of a diversity
measurement from ecology studies to provide evidence of other market

laborious process. The clearer view of what media pluralism involves
and the creation of a measurement for evaluating its conditions clearly
advance consideration of pluralism policymaking. The initiatives make
clear that the core concern of media pluralism is that media content
should represent the range of concerns and ideas found across society,
not merely those of media owners or dominant elements in society
created by class, race, culture, or geography

In terms of policy trajectory, the European concept of pluralism
has changed from a narrow focus on the political perspectives represented
in media and their owners to a wider concept of ensuring media
inclusiveness of all members of society by ensuring that their issues,
views and perspectives are represented

provide a clear-cut example of the latter, the popular analytical concept of partisan media
bias is juxtaposed to the alternative framework of de/politicization.

In other words,
since the analytical concept of partisan media bias excludes those matters where there is
ideological convergence between both parties (say, global neoliberal capitalism and
American imperialism), it only allows for evaluating pluralism ‘within the box’, that is,
within the limits of existing social consensus.

messages. Given that message-diversity measures surprise, a lower value of messagediversity
means that the message has distinct topic properties, whereas a higher value means
that the message has diverse topic properties. The messages whose topic probabilities slightly
vary across different topics tend to yield a higher value of message-diversity. Therefore, e(xi),

critics, and policy-makers have used the concept of diversity as a normative
goal for democratic media. A well-functioning media system has frequently
been associated with the extent to which it facilitates the dissemination of a
large array of ideas and viewpoints from a diverse range of sources, in order to
foster the existence of an informed citizenry, an environment of inclusiveness
and, ultimately, stable and effective self-governance (Napoli, 2001).

Translating this so-called “diversity principle” into media system
assessment has often taken the form of efforts to assess the range of sources
and viewpoints represented in traditional mass media outlets (Napoli, 1999).

The diversity of content on the Internet does not translate to
the diversity of reception. As Napoli (2011, p. 246) notes, “with all of the
information outlets currently available, focusing on source and content
diversity is becoming less important than understanding the information that
is actually consumed by media users.” One of the key challenges, then, is to

Kohring, 2008;","At the same time, the focal matter of contention
– the diversity of viewpoints – notoriously eludes definition and measurement (Benson,
2009). Specifically, it remains unclear which observed variations in the news meaningfully
contribute to viewpoint diversity (Napoli, 1999)

Focusing on the diversity of news content (Napoli, 1999), we review available
research and theorizing to discuss the concept’s normative relevance and operational
specification.

While most conceptualizations of democratic debates depend on some notion of viewpoint
diversity, they emphasize different aspects, and differ in how much diversity is
deemed adequate

In our view, speaker-oriented approaches to viewpoint diversity offer little help for
deciding whose viewpoints should be represented: they either externalize the problem
by privileging positional elites, or implicitly refer to content-based criteria by inviting
speakers expected to contribute different interpretations. By contrast, content-oriented
views approximate the representation of all relevant aspects of a concern: they provide
both measures and criteria for discriminating valuable from redundant contributions

Most available measures of viewpoint diversity
access the diversity of interpretations only indirectly (Voakes et al., 1996)

Other studies assess viewpoint diversity using content analytic methodology (Hayes and Guardino, 2010; Humprecht and Büchel, 2013;
Muschert, 2009). However, it is not always transparent how their indicators were chosen
and can validly and relatively exhaustively capture the available interpretations (Voakes
et al., 1996).

However, diverse sources may
echo the same few interpretations; likewise, few actors can present a wider or narrower
diversity of viewpoints (Ferree et al., 2002; Holcomb et al., 2011; Voakes et al., 1996

Among those approaches focusing on the diversity of news content, three related strategies
emphasize the tone or political position represented in the news: in the simplest
case, viewpoint diversity is considered high if official viewpoints are contrasted against
some counterframes (Bennett, 1990; Hanitzsch and Mellado, 2011; Hayes and Guardino,
2010)

A slightly more differentiated variant assesses the diversity of tones
attached to political issues (Hayes and Guardino, 2010).

A third approach codes political slant (Ho and Quinn, 2008; Pritchard, 2002). At
least in multiparty systems, this approach can distinguish also beyond two interpretations,
albeit in rather coarse grain.

In this article, we consider all frames as diverse that contribute to different interpretative
repertoires

A first approach is to simply determine
the number of distinct patterns in which the respective logics are used for specific framing
functions (number of viewpoints) – for example, by applying some clustering/topic
modeling or, dimension reduction technique (Baden and Springer, 2014; Matthes and
Kohring, 2008).

Therefore, second,
we can assess the uniqueness of ‘entries’ for the different ‘slots’ in constructed
frames (viewpoint variability): a repertoire wherein each ‘slot’ is uniquely assigned has
lower viewpoint diversity than one allowing variable entries to be combined without
breaking coherence.

Third, we can derive
another criterion of viewpoint diversity from the assumptions required to render detected
repertoires coherent (viewpoint distinctness): assumptions made by different repertoires
can overlap (e.g. sharing moral evaluation standards)

A debate wherein all advanced repertoires
are at least passively compatible is, accordingly, less diverse than one that includes
viewpoints that cannot simultaneously be accepted. If we apply such measures alongside
the more conventional coding of actors represented in the coverage, not only can we
assess whether and when additional speakers increase the diversity of viewpoints represented",Yes,'The news' or 'the media' in general without any further specifications,,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public)",,Related to viewpoints or perspectives (also includes: frames; whether it includes conservative or liberal positions),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Article on how to conceptualise and measure (qualitatively) viewpoint diversity in media content; article with a lot of very detailed information, might be interesting to code it again later"

although the ratio of links to information resources shared by both Facebook audi- ences compared with links to information resources from only one of the two groups was about even (49.5–50.5%), the commonly shared resources were very small in number (12.2% sources were shared compared to 87.8% that were linked to by either Maddow or O’Reilly but not both),

To determine the relationship between links from the two Facebook Pages, the NodeXL software was used to aid in the network analysis. Network analysis is an emerging area of online communi- cation analysis. It is different from content analysis in that network analysis evaluates the relationships between and among units of content rather than the nature of the content itself (Guo, 2012). Using the show name as one vertex and the links generated by the audience as the second vertex, the software helped visualize the number of unique links from each Facebook Page as well as where the links overlapped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Yes - look up the source(s) in the references and copy the doi (or other identifying information if not present) here,"Sunstein’s (2001, 2006); (Morozov, 2011; Pariser, 2011; Shirky, 2003)","The power-law distribution of links may lend support to scholars concerned with the Internet’s potential to become an echo chamber.

Qualitative content analysis is an inductive process which 'may yield testable hypotheses but that is not its immediate purpose' (White and Marsh, 2006, p. 34). The process consists of four steps: 1) define research question(s), 2) sample the units (threads) which enables complete and accurate answers to the questions and present the big picture, 3) identify significant concepts and patterns, and 4) analysis. Because there is a lack of thread analyses of Twitter conversations and hence a rationale for studying such conversations, the choice of using qualitative analysis is justified. The approach taken is exploratory, and question generating rather than theory generating. ","Drawing on Zubiaga et al. (2015), three dimensions were used: type of message (e.g., assertion, question, opinion, facts), type of response in relation to replied-to tweet (e.g., answer, evasive answer, question, rhetorical question, requesting source, agreement, disagreement, topic change) and context (e.g., polarised branch, echo chamber branch).

This holistic view of the political media environment is beneficial in that it integrates multiple levels of analysis by demonstrating both the audience for each political media outlet as well as the news repertoires for different audiences (Webster & Ksiazek, 2012). This approach takes individual-level exposure patterns, scales them to the aggregate, and analyzes them in the context of the entire political information diet of a particular audience. 

The political media network here is defined as a set of media outlets (the nodes), with the shared users between each pair of outlets constituting a link. Any two nodes were connected if a respondent reported using both outlets. The measure of link strength was the number of times two outlets were connected across all respondents. Two comple- mentary network analyses in UCINET were used (Borgatti, Everett, & Freeman, 2009).

This puts the most connected outlets in the center of the network, with those less connected in the periphery. Second, a continuous core-periphery analysis was conducted to provide empirical validation of the visual network (Borgatti & Everett, 1999). This procedure estimates a “coreness” score for each outlet and suggests a core- periphery solution that confirms whether each outlet is located in the core or periphery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Partisanship,,,,,Other,Looking at the information diets people have and whether outlets are from the center or periphery and whether they use general interest or partisan outlets,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Measures echo chambers by asking people about their media diets, then looking at whether partisans also incorporate different outlets into their media diets (and they did).

DC is the degree of how many different things are described in two news articles reporting the same event. We estimate DC from two aspects: 1) how many different factors are mentioned in these articles, and 2) whether these articles are related to the same event or not. For aspect 1), we can simply compare the entities mentioned in articles. The more different the entities two articles describe, the higher the dif- ference in factor coverage between the two articles is. As- pect 2) corresponds to relatedness. However, relatedness at the level of two articles is not suitable for DC because two articles having different factors and the same factors are in- tuitively contradictory. Therefore, for aspect 2), we compare the entity mentioned in each article with a core entity set of the given event (of the related news articles).
Let Ecore be the set of core entities of a certain news event. DC between articles a and o, dc(a, o) is calculated as follows:

We compare the description polarities (positive, negative, and neutral) on named entities in articles. If two news articles report the same entities while their polarities are different, we regard these two articles to contain dif- ferent opinions. We extract descriptions of named entities through our named entity mining method and use an emo- tional word dictionary to assign a polarity score to each de- scription. In the work described here, we used SentiWord- Net [16] as the emotional word dictionary and the descrip- tive polarities method of Ogawa et al. [11].

The sum score of emotional words in descriptions of a named entity is the final description polarity of the named entity. After that, we compare the polarity of each entity in articles o and a. Let pola(e) and polo(e) be the polarity of named entity e ∈ {Ea ∪ Eo}, (if e 􏱓 Eo, let polo(e) = 0; if e 􏱓 Ea, let pola(e) = 0).

After extracting named- entity related descriptions, we apply Latent Dirichlet Allo- cation) [17] to detected topics from the description of named entities by the Mallet LDA [18]. The difference in detailed- ness for named entity e between articles a and o is calculated through the following steps.
1. We extract all descriptions S (e) of named entity e from the articles describing the same event as articles a and o. Then, we apply LDA to extract the topics T(e) for entity e.
2. So(e) and Sa(e) are defined as sets of descriptions of named entity e in articles a and o, respectively. On the basis of results of LDA, we assign topic probabilities po(so, t) and pa(sa, t) to sentences so ∈ S o(e) and sa ∈ S a (e), respectively. (t ∈ T (e)).
3. If the topic probability Po(so, t) is more than threshold γ, t is the topic for descriptions of named entity e in article o. We apply this operation to all sentences in S o(e) and obtain topic sets To(e) and Ta(e).
4. Let atie , otie be the numbers of words in topic tie ∈ {T a (e) ∪ T o (e)} in article a and o, respectively (if tie 􏱓 To(e), let otie = 0 and if tie 􏱓 Ta(e), let atie = 0).

A sample of 1.100 Flemish respondents was drawn from an existing panel database (through Belgian market research company iVOX) of more than 100.000 registrants, frequently used in other commercial and scientific studies. 

The questionnaire contained thirteen multiple choice questions investigating respondents’ knowledge of media ownership structures. A mix of media outlets was chosen, including newspaper, magazine, radio and television brands, spread over different (commercial) media groups.

Respondents were thus asked to link four newspapers (De Standaard, Het Laatste Nieuws, De Morgen, Gazet van Antwerpen) and three magazines (Dag Allemaal, Trends Magazine, P-Magazine) to the correct media group (with De Persgroep, Sanoma, Concentra, Corelio, Think Media, Roularta and ‘I do not know’ as possible answers). For the audio-visual outlets (television stations VIER and Acht, and radio station Q-Music) respondents could opt for one of five answers (VRT, VMMa, Concentra, Woestijnvis/Sanoma/Corelio, ‘I do not know’). Finally, respondents had to name the CEO of three media groups or brands (De Persgroep, VIER and Telenet), each time selecting from five possible answers (Christian Van Thillo, Thomas Leysen, Patrick Tillieux, Duco Sickinghe, ‘I do not know’). Given the online context of the survey, some respondents may have searched the web to answer the question, yet they were encouraged to answer spontaneously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Study about whether people know the media ownership structures/know about how concentrated the media system is (opposite to diversity).

The discipline or disciplines of each cited journal were identified from Journal Citation Reports (2012), which describes more than 8000 scholarly journals published worldwide.
If a journal was cited explicitly, the jour- nal’s name was recorded. If a journal was mentioned without citing its name, the author did not seek to determine the journal or record it as a citation. These data enabled the author to compute the number of citations to journals and the number of distinct journals cited each year. Each of these was converted to rates by dividing by the number of articles published by Science Times dur- ing the period.

Measuring media pluralism therefore requires the selection of those indicators that are more appropriate to the key focus of the study. The difficulty in measuring media pluralism is perhaps demonstrated by the failure by the European Union (EU) to adopt a harmonised approach to the matter, opting instead for the subsidiarity principle which gives member states ultimate discretion in choosing an appropriate regulatory model. Although the EU has taken a cautious position against a harmonised approach to measuring media pluralism in its member states, it nevertheless recognises the need to closely monitor media pluralism in the light of its critical role in a democracy. Consequently, the EU has proposed an evidence-based regulatory approach which shifts attention from regulating to monitoring media pluralism.

In proposing a risk-based regulatory approach, the EU has come up with a Media Pluralism Monitor (MPM).

This first step generates coefficient estimates describing the direction and intensity of each media program’s partisanship based on the composition of their audiences.4 Estimated coefficients for a subsection of the shows are shown in Figure 1, with a complete listing of estimated coefficients in Supplemental Appendix 2.
(2) We use the coefficient estimates generated in Step 1 to calculate each respondent’s predicted probability to prefer McCain based solely on media consumption, suppressing the constant term generated in Step 1.5
(3) We calculate the predicted probability of preferring Obama as 1 minus the probability of preferring McCain.
(4) We calculate the absolute value of the difference between these two probabilities.
The four-step process results in the PMDI, a measure bounded between 0 and 1. For example, the estimated coefficients (Step 1) were large in magnitude but opposite in direction for Countdown with Keith Olbermann (β = -.77) and The Rush Limbaugh Show (β = .90), the most extreme programs on the left and right, respectively. If we calculate PMDI for a hypothetical individual who consumed only Limbaugh’s show, his/her predicted probability of voting for McCain during the primaries was 0.716 (Step 2), yielding a predicted probability of voting for Obama of 0.29 (Step 3), and a PMDI of 0.42 (Step 4). An individual who consumed both shows (but only these shows) would have a predicted probability of voting for McCain of 0.537 (Step 2), a probability of supporting Obama of 0.47 (Step 3) and a PMDI of 0.06 (Step 4).
Importantly, PMDI measures the partisan imbalance of media content and not the diversity of programs per se.Individuals with a PMDI score close to 1 were thus individuals whose media diet strongly favors one candidate, indicating that the content of their media diet was strongly partisan from one side of the ideological spectrum without any exposure to counter-attitudinal arguments. In contrast, people with values close to 0 were exposed to balanced content in their media diets because they consumed neutral media and/or equal amounts of partisan media from each side. A respon- dent might have a low PMDI score because he or she watches internally diverse shows (neutral programs which present views from both sides of the ideological spectrum) or externally diverse shows (equal amounts of partisan media associated Republicans and Democrats).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Introducing a new tool to measure the imbalance of an individual's media diet by using survey answers.

We thus follow the literature (Groseclose and Milyo 2005; Gentzkow and Shapiro 2010, 2011) and focus on the slant at the outlet level, ultimately assigning articles the polarity score of the outlet in which they were published. By doing so, we clearly lose some signal. For instance, we mislabel liberal op-eds on generally conservative news sites, and we mark neutral reporting of a breaking event as having the overall slant of the outlet. Nevertheless, such a compromise is common practice, and where possible, we attempt to mitigate any resulting biases.

Our solution is to construct an audience-based measure of outlet slant (Tewksbury 2005; Lawrence, Sides, and Farrell 2010; Gentzkow and Shapiro 2011). Specifically, we estimate the fraction of each news outlet’s readership that voted for the Republican candidate in the most recent presiden- tial election, which we call the outlet’s conservative share. Thus, left-leaning, or “liberal,” outlets have conservative shares less than about 50 percent, and right- leaning, or “conservative,” outlets have conservative shares greater than about 50 percent.

To estimate the political composition of a news outlet’s readership, we use the location of each webpage view as inferred from the IP address. We can then measure how the popularity of a news outlet varies across counties as a function of the counties’ political compositions, which in turn yields the estimates we desire.

While our measure of conservative share is admittedly imperfect, the list does seem largely consistent with commonly held beliefs on the slant of particular outlets.6 Furthermore, as shown in figure 1, our ranking of news sites is highly correlated with the survey-based measure of audience ideology derived from a Pew (2014) study.7 Among the seventeen news sources on both lists, the cor- relation was 0.81. We similarly find a correlation of 0.82 among the top twenty domains in the Gentzkow and Shapiro (2011) list based on 2008 audience data, and 0.77 correlation among the top twenty domains in the Bakshy, Messing, and Adamic (2015) list based on Facebook data. 

We now define the polarity of an individual to be the typical polarity of the news outlet that he or she visits. We then define segregation to be the expected distance between the polarity scores of two randomly selected users. This definition of segregation, which is in line with past work (Dandekar, Goel, and Lee 2013), intuitively captures the idea that segregated populations are those in which pairs of individuals are, on average, far apart.

We thus estimate segregation via a hierarchical Bayesian model (Gelman and Hill 2007), as described in more detail below",Related to outlets/sources (e.g. number of different media sources),,,,,,,"Other, namely:",Analysis of browsing histories,No,,,,,,,,No,,No,,No,,"We define four channels through which an individual can discover a news story: direct, aggregator, social, and search. The intuition behind this method is that a user is very unlikely to directly type in a specific long URL, so the visit must have a referrer, which can be inferred from the time series of URLs. The heuristic thus is based on two key assumptions: first, users do not typi- cally type in the long, unwieldy web addresses assigned to individual articles, but rather are directed there via a previous visit to a top-level domain and a subsequent chain of clicks; and second, top-level domains are not typically shared or posted via e-mail, social media, or aggregators. 

As with the analysis in the Overall Segregation section, the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix Σp yield estimates of segregation for each of the eight subjectivity-by-channel categories. In particular, letting σk2 denote the k-th diagonal entry of Σp, segregation in the k-th category is   2σk. Table 3 lists these diagonal parameter estimates.9 The off-diagonal entries of Σp measure the relationship between categories of one’s ideological exposure.

This is because the filter bubble has become a term that encom- passes various criticisms. These criticisms differ because democracy is essentially a contested concept and different democracy models require different norms. As this paper will show, some will criticize the filter bubble due to its negative effect on user autonomy and choice, while others emphasize the diminishing quality of information and deliberation.

The first structures the articles on a multilevel hierarchy of topics, and the second provides the structure across the people, organizations, and locations that appear in those articles.

To provide these annotations, we use the Enrycher (Štajner et al. 2010) system. The topic classification is done with a hierarchical classification approach (Gro- belnik and Mladenić 2004) into the DMOZ hierarchy as the data set. The entity extraction and disam- biguation uses a knowledge-base approach (Štajner
and Mladenić 2009) to disambiguate into DBPedia

To detect subtopics, we partition the articles com- prising a story into at most five clusters using agglom- erative k-means clustering based on bag-of-words vectors and the cosine similarity function. From each cluster, we then extract three terms with the highest tf-idf weight in its centroid and use them as the description of the subtopic. 

The map widget requires us to know the location information for individual articles.

(1) We crawled, parsed, and integrated a number of public, hand-curated news publisher listings that provide for each publisher, among other informa- tion, the city and country of origin. (2) If available, we use the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) to determine the country. For example, guardian.co.uk is mapped to the United Kingdom. (3) As a last resort, we query the WHOIS databases and heuristically parse out the address of the domain’s owner

uses a multilayer classifier that first performs several inde- pendent predictions on the basis of individual fea- ture sets (words, lexicon features, as well as ortho- graphic features), followed by an aggregation classifier that produces the final result. We trained the classifier on an annotated news corpus (Balahur et al. 2010), combined with SentiWordNet (Bac- cianella, Esuli, and Sebastiani 2010), achieving an F1 score of 0.78.
The classifier outputs a continuous value based on its prediction confidence to allow for better visuali- zation and comparison of individual news articles.

When the user moves the controls in the story explo- ration screen, the articles are reranked to reflect the change. The ranking is computed based on the good- ness of fit of each article to the position of user con- trols. The goodness of fit score is a linear combina- tion of the three distances between the target value of a control and an article’s value. The world map uses the logarithm of the Haversine distance, the top- ical map uses the Euclidean distance in the two- dimensional plane, and the sentiment slider uses the squared difference between the target sentiment and the article sentiment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Uses various methods of automated annotation of news to present the user different ways to get diverse news.

LDA identifies topics as mixtures of terms, and treat documents as mixtures of topics. Each topic is represented by a probability distribution over the vocabulary of all terms, where the probability values convey the affinity for a given term to a particular topic.

We preprocessed the tweets by case-folding (converted all English characters to lowercase), and removed URLs, @user mentions, punctuation, emoticons, and so on, and also removed a set of well-known English stop-words. Hash- tags were treated similar to other words in this analysis, for example, the hashtag “#christmas” and the word “christmas” were considered as the same term. We then used the GibbsLDA++ implementation of LDA [Phan and Nguyen 2007] to identify topics.

Hence, we use N = 100 topics (as also used by Morstatter et al. [2013]), and default values of the GibbsLDA++ tool for the other parameters: α = 50/N, and β = 0.1. 

A topic identified by LDA (henceforth denoted as a LDA-topic) is essentially a distribution over the terms in the vocabulary of the dataset. We conducted another AMT survey to map the LDA-topics to broad topics understandable by human beings, such as politics, sports, education, entertainment, and so on.

Each AMT evaluator was shown the top 10 terms in a LDA-topic, (i.e., the 10 terms that were assigned the highest probability values for this topic by LDA) and

was asked to indicate the most relevant broad topic. The evaluators were also given the option to indicate that a particular LDA-topic could not be related to any of the given broad topics. Similar to the AMT survey described in Section 5.1, each LDA-topic was judged independently by three evaluators; there was unanimous agreement in case of about 48% of the LDA-topics, and a majority agreement (i.e., two of the three evaluators indicated the same broad topic) in case of about 90% LDA-topics.10
The results of the user survey are summarized in Table VI. It is seen that a sub- stantial fraction (21 out of 100) of the LDA-topics identified from the random digest could not be mapped to any of the broad topics. These topics are mostly related to daily conversation, greetings, colloquial/slang words, and so on (some examples are shown later in Table VIII). Furthermore, 50% of the LDA-topics identified from the random digest are related to only 2 of the 10 broad topics—lifestyle and culture (e.g., celebrity news, Christmas celebrations, fashion), and entertainment (e.g., music and television shows)—while the other broad topics are much less represented. In fact, two of the broad topics—arts & humanities and environment & weather—are not at all repre- sented among the LDA-topics identified from the random digest. In contrast, not only could LDA identify a much larger set of meaningful topics from the expert digest (94 out of the 100 LDA-topics could be mapped to one of the broad topics), but also these LDA-topics cover all the specified broad topics.11 This shows that the tweets in the expert digest cover a much wider diversity of topics, compared to the random digest.

We then measure the similarity between two LDA-topics by the Jaccard score of the corresponding sets of terms (similar to Morstatter et al. [2013]).For each LDA-topic in one digest, we attempt to find similar topic(s) in the other digest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Expert user sample vs random sample,,,,,Other,"No specific test, just looking at the topics that were covered (comparing which were in both etc)","Other (not mentioned or qualitative study, please fill in how the authors judge the influence)","It is evident that if one collects only the random digest, one may potentially miss spe- cialized information on various topics such as politics, sports, technology, and economy.

These examples as well as the data provided in Table 2 lend support to H1a: as the analysis of the topics covered revealed, outlets seem to have different profiles, especially with regard to the share of articles devoted to hard politics as opposed to human-interest news. While it is, of course, to a certain extent arbitrary when one can speak of content differences large enough to support the hypothesis, in our case, dif- ferences are not only significant, but so large (with, for example, the percentage of arti- cles on politics ranging between 12 and 50 per cent) that we feel safe to say: with regard to news topics, the content requirement for fragmented use is met.",Related to viewpoints or perspectives (also includes: frames; whether it includes conservative or liberal positions),,,,,,,"Content Analysis (quantitative, manual or (semi-)annotated )",,No,,,,,,,,No,,No,,No,,"Political bias, i.e., positivity/negativity towards the major Austrian political parties, was coded as coder estimates on a five-point scale from extremely negative to extre- mely positive for each political party.

It was not necessary that the author made an explicit judgment—rather, clearly nega- tive topics like scandals and clearly positive topics like overwhelming victories in elec- tions were coded as such. To maximize reliability, a number of examples were provided. Therefore, even though one might fear that the conceptualization could lead to arbitrary coder decisions (Goldman and Mutz 2011), the measurement delivered α values between 0.93 and 1.0.

However, for none of the outlets were we able to detect a statistically significant political bias towards a specific party. As Table 3 shows, political parties are treated broadly the same, but above all were not mentioned too often.

Youth’s widespread adoption of sharing and creation techniques has several implications for notions of diversity. At the conceptual level, increased interactivity suggests that traditional categories such as producers, distributors, and recipients are blurring when applied to youth and news online. Viewed from this phenomenological angle, diversity models will have to take into account the interactive relationship between what has previously been labeled the audience, as part of exposure diversity, and nontraditional co-creators of news, as part of source diversity. As youth are no longer only consumers but also co-creators and sharers of news, traditional notions of source and content diversity now might take into account demographic or ethnic diversity outside the familiar dimensions of organizational and economic structures of professional media companies.

First, we extracted the count- matrix representation for each dataset with D documents, where each row repre- sents a document d (1 ≤ d ≤ D) and each column j represents a topic category (1 ≤ j ≤ T). each cell (d, j) in this matrix indicates how many elements in docu- ment d (i.e., word tokens) belong to category j (i.e., topics). then, we identified the topics using the LDA method with Gibbs sampling (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003; DiMaggio, Nag, and Blei 2013). this method requires specifying in advance the number of topics to be identified; we set this parameter as T = 100, which in the past has been shown to generally produce coherent topics (Hong and Davison 2010; rosen-zvi et al. 2004). We expect broadly similar results with other values of T∈[10,400]. Once the matrix D × T is created for each dataset, we calculate the average diversity of all documents following the equation:

and P(i|d),P(j|d) are the proportion of words in document d that are assigned to topics i and j, respectively. the term δ(i, j) is a measure of the distance between topics i and j. We measure this pairwise distance using the Jensen- Shannon divergence, which captures the similarity between two probability dis- tributions—in this case, the columns in the D × T matrix, or topics.

On the one hand, ‘diversity’ has to be located on the ontic dimension of the social, as it regards mere physical or empirical differences, such as the range of identities and concerns (differences within society)

‘affirmative diversity’ is represented by the metaphors of media as ‘mirrors of society’ and ‘marketplaces of ideas’ and draws on the liberal-aggre- gative school of democratic theory. Conceptually, it relates to ‘diversity’ as it expects media to truthfully reflect the existing social heterogeneity.

Research starting from the affirmative diversity-approach is concerned about a bal- anced media representation of social diversity, for instance, in terms of actors, issues, and viewpoints.

However, instead of focusing solely on media content, their concern lays mainly with the commercial interests and mechanisms of media organizations and the routines of media practitioners, and how these determine the level of diversity within media coverage. Clearly, the research field is divided because of the unlimited range of structural charac- teristics. For example, regarding ownership, research can focus on ownership concentra- tion (e.g. Hanretty, 2014), the agenda of owners (e.g. Anand et al., 2007), ownership structures (e.g. Yanich, 2010), or ownership limits (e.g. Horwitz, 2005).",Yes,'The news' or 'the media' in general without any further specifications,,Not specified,,No dimensions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,No,,"which allows us to systematically differentiate between whether social heterogeneity is addressed on an empirical (i.e. diversity) or ideological level (i.e. pluralism).

Media pluralism interpreted as ‘affirmative pluralism’ is represented by the metaphor of media as ‘public forums’ and draws on the deliberative school of democratic theory. Conceptually, it addresses the notion of ‘pluralism’

Research starting from the affirmative pluralism-approach focuses both on the diver- sity of identities and concerns – mostly addressed as ‘inclusivity’ – and on the ways dif- ferent identities and concerns are discursively portrayed. In that sense, concerns about quantity and ratio are complemented with concerns about quality.

the criti- cal pluralism-approach is represented by the metaphor of media as ‘sites of struggle’ or ‘fields of contestation’. Conceptually, the metaphor relates to the notion of ‘pluralism’: It is concerned with the discursive contestation of ideological viewpoints.

Diversity, in turn, more frequently describes the variety of content available to or consumed by citizen

From the first perspective, diversity is generated by a plurality of available media or content, and the latter conceptualizes media diversity as a result of user behavior. In this vein, McQuail (1992, p. 157) differentiates “content as sent” from “content as received.”

The notion of exposure diversity assumes that pluralism is achieved when users actually enjoy a diverse media diet (Hagel & Brown, 2009; van Cuilenburg, 1998)

Based on SCT, we argue that both supply diversity and exposure diversity are necessary but not sufficient conditions of media pluralism in the digital age.

Yet, mere exposure is not synonymous with actual attention to and perception and experience of diversity (Goodman, 2004).

We define diversity experience as the cognitive processing of diverse information.

Thus, diversity exposure—the encountering of diverse content—results in diversity experience only if users perceive and digest this content according to their motivations, awareness, and capabilities.

The social cognitive perspective on media diversity is particularly helpful in the analysis of media diversity in the digital age because it stresses the importance of personal influences as a complement to environmental/institutional (supply) and behavioral (exposure) aspects

These challenges can be understood as three barriers that users must overcome to experience media diversity in an online environment:
1. Users may not be motivated to seek out diversity.
2. Users may not be aware of current limits to diversity.
3. Users may not be able to ensure access to diversity.

Based on SCT, we propose that the pluralism debate must employ a user-centric perspective and thereby extend beyond the assumption that supply diversity equals diversity exposure

The public-service media play a critical role in that context. An aspect that has been less prominent in traditional diversity policies is the actual choices users make as another, different dimension of media diversity—known as “diversity of exposure” (Napoli, 1999) or “content as received” (McQuail, 1992).

Exposure diversity examines the audience dimension of media diversity and asks to what extent the diversity of content and supply actually results in a (more) diverse program consumption.

 Evidence from empirical studies demonstrates that, although it is a necessary precondition, “on its own diversity of supply cannot secure diversity of reception” (McQuail, 1992, p. 158) or “diversity of choice” (Van der Wurff, 2004) for the audience.

Although far from being a comprehensive definition of exposure diversity, the Ofcom definition gives at least some guidance on what exposure diversity from a user perspective could mean: to be “able to access and consume a wide range of viewpoints across a variety of platforms and media owners” (Ofcom, 2012, p. 8).

In practice, regulatory schemes feature combinations of at least three components—diversity of content, of source, and of distribution platform—but it is diversity of content that lies at the core of media pluralism.

Diversity of source relates to the origin of the content.

Diversity of distribution refers to the various delivery services that select and present material directly to the audience.

It is evident that the underlying theme in policy discussion of media pluralism, across all its dimensions of diversity, is that information should simply be accessible. All that is required is that members of a democratic society should be exposed to the range of different viewpoints that exist and should have their viewpoints adequately represented (Council of Europe, 2003; Craufurd Smith, 1997; Hitchens, 2007; Valcke et al., 2010). As the Council of Europe (1999) has stated, “It should be stressed that pluralism is about diversity in the media that is made available to the public, which does not always coincide with what is actually consumed” (para. 3

Another strand of thinking, which moves the discussion a little closer to a more active conception of media pluralism, is the literature on exposure diversity (Helberger, 2012; Napoli, 2011)

Exposure diversity is therefore concerned with the audience and user dimensions of media pluralism and the extent to which diversity of supply actually leads to diverse consumption.

First, a concern with active pluralism is one that will be mainly focused on diversity of content.

Political pluralism, which is about the need, in the interests of democracy, for a wide range of political opinions and viewpoints to be represented in the media. Democracy would be threatened if any single voice within the media, with the power to propagate a single political viewpoint, were to become too dominant. Cultural pluralism, which is about the need for a variety of cultures, as reflects the diversity within society, to find expression in the media. (Council of Europe, 1999, para. 4)

In media policy, the idea of pluralism is often used interchangeably with notions such as “diversity,” “plurality of information” and “multiplicity of voices.”

Typically, diversity of source implies that content will be provided by a number of separate organizations—that is, external pluralism, also described as “structural pluralism” (Council of Europe, 1999, para. 3)

What is notable about these varying responses to the fact of pluralism is this: They all suppose that the foundations for a stable political order depend on the different parties engaging with each other, whether to agree common ground, or—in the spirit of Locke’s arguments for toleration—to trade their values or interests for the sake of reaching a practical accommodation.

By contrast to such active conceptions of pluralism, as suggested, the response adopted in media policy is essentially nominal and passive, being content to make provision for the mere presence of differing perspectives in the public domain

Such “active pluralism” would require the deployment of measures that encourage conversation, dialogue, and understanding engagement between different strands of opinion and identity.

This means that the focus of measures for active pluralism would also tend to be on internal pluralism—that is, the variety of material offered by a single media organization, since it is within such an organization that the relationship between different kinds of content can be managed",Yes,'The news' or 'the media' in general without any further specifications,,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public),Exposure perspective (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} consumed by the audience, i.e. what they read, view, click on; more focussed on what is displayed to the individual),Other (fill in)",active pluralism,Related to viewpoints or perspectives (also includes: frames; whether it includes conservative or liberal positions),,political pluralism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Theoretical article, not making much of a distinction between diversity and pluralism; however, introducing the concept of active pluralism and why PBS should engage in it.

The so-called “diversity principle“ builds on the premise, popular also among policy- makers, that diverse ownership brings diverse content and that diverse content automati- cally brings about a lively, democratic and open public sphere. 

If we look at the principle from the general perspective, the European research tradition mainly refers to “pluralism“ that stems from media diversity, resulting in “the presence of a number of different and independent voices, and of differing political opinions and representations of culture within the media“ (Doyle 2002, 11), whereas the Anglo-American researchers prefer the term “diver- sity“ and the “marketplace of ideas”

However, the “marketplace of ideas” still does not specify various dimensions of diversity. In order to embrace the variations in space, sources and ideas, I will use Phillip M. Napoli’s conceptualisation of the deconstructed diver- sity, which consists of the “exposure diversity”, “source diversity“ (marking ownership and workforce diversity) and “content diversity”, that in turn consists also of the program- type format, demographic and idea/viewpoint diversity (Napoli 1999, 10).

 These two explain the het- erogeneity of the content according to the criteria of whether or not the media reflect and report on a given relative distribution of opinions in society, or media enable all various opinions and positions to get the same amount of attention (Cuilenburg 1999, 189–190). 

However, it potentially opens the (transna- tional) public sphere and heightens the conditions for “exposure diversity”. It designates “diversity of content as received”, which according to McQuail is an audience-oriented measure of plurality, “what the audience actually selects“ (1992, 157).

Innovations and competition are fruitful for product diversification as long as only a handful of companies innovate and compete, which leads to the contradiction whereby more media outlets mean less diversity. 

This also means that it is not the market structure per se which affects the diversity, but the central drive to valorise capital through the production of media content as exchange values",Yes,The media market overall (e.g. not related to specific media outlets),,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public),Exposure perspective (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} consumed by the audience, i.e. what they read, view, click on; more focussed on what is displayed to the individual)",,"Related to outlets/sources (e.g. number of different media sources),Other, namely:",,,,diverse ownership,content diversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Theoretically talks about the different conceptualisations of diversity (taking Napoli, Cuilenburg, and McQuail as example) and noting that ownership diversity and content diversity do not necessarily go hand in hand (although not really clear how he gets to the conclusion as no real method is applied)"

Using 37 questions, we measured self-reported exposure to a series of ideological media outlets (the ideological tendency of the outlets was independently established by the researcher), as well as those considered mainstream.6 Respondents were asked to what extent they were exposed to a list of right-wing and left-wing outlets. Response categories varied between 0 for not exposed at all and 5 for exposed regularly. In the next phase, we created two separate measures of ideologically congruent right-wing and left-wing exposure by averaging the 15 items measuring right- wing exposure ( ̨ D .79, M D 2.05, SD D .65) and the 13 items measuring left-wing exposure ( ̨ D .85, M D 2.01, SD D .71).
To obtain the selective exposure score and crosscutting exposure score, these scales were collapsed into two scales as follows: Using each partici- pant’s score on the political-leaning scale, his or her position was determined regarding the above two media exposure scales, namely, one for the right wing and the other for the left wing. For participants who scored between 5 and 7, exposure to media outlets advocating left-wing ideology was marked as exposure to like-minded media, while their exposure to media outlets advocating right-wing ideology was marked as crosscutting exposure. For participants who scored between 1 and 3, the opposite was carried out. The political orientation of the 125 participants who scored 4 was further investigated according to their attitudes as measured in the survey (see description of attitudes measured below). Individuals were asked to specify their opinions regarding the four issues on which they supplied estimations of public opinion. Of these participants, 37% held attitudes leaning to the left, 57% held attitudes leaning to the right, and 6% held attitudes in the center. The latter 6% (8 participants) were not included in the analysis, while the former two groups were categorized together with other participants according to the previously described process (selective exposure M D 1.5, SD D.60; crosscutting exposure M D 1.3, SD D .50).

We also coded whether the speaker championing the argument used partisan (e.g., advocated for or against a position) or neutral (e.g., simply presented an argument) language.

A frame was coded “partisan” if it was clear from the language used that an actor agreed or disagreed with the argument (e.g., “It is obvious to any educated citizen that Terri is being discriminated against”). A frame was coded as “neutral” if an actor mentioned or discussed the argument but did not indicate support for or opposition to the ideas (e.g., “Some disability groups argue that Terri is being discriminated against by the medical establishment”).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Ownership,Political ideology,geographic region,news format,,Regression,,Yes,,"Mixed influence (some negative, some positive)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Regression,,Yes,,"Mixed influence (some negative, some positive)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Regression,,Yes,,Positive influence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Regression,,Yes,,Positive influence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Measures diversity by the number of different frames that appear in a news article.

Therefore, if this space is expanded, regardless of whether or not this results in greater concentration of media ownership, or further com- modification of user-data online, competition between actors will be increased and power dispersed, generating ‘media counter-power’ (Castells, 2009). This understanding of pluralism may not herald market forces as a guarantor of freedom, but it nonetheless claims that the internet, regardless of its ever-increasing capture by free market media, will empower sovereign audiences through the creative autonomy bestowed upon them.

An alternative model of democracy is the egalitarian-welfarist model. Such model considers information as a public good and freedom of information as a substantial democratic right. Therefore, diversity means organised pluralism, with a ‘segmented structure of media outlets and providers representing different social groups, cultural communities and political orientations’ (Klimkiewicz, 2009: 47).

When we asked people to explain what the word meant to them (see Makri & Blandford, 2012), we found that serendipitous experiences involved three ‘essential ingredients’: unexpected circumstances (the ‘accident’), an insightful ‘aha’ moment (the ‘sagacity’) and a valuable or potentially valuable outcome (the ‘happy’). This outcome must also be unanticipated as “no discovery of a thing you are looking for comes under this description [Walpole’s emphasis]” (Merton & Barber, 2004, p. 2).

We recruited by e-mail, which stated we would be observing them carrying out a real or realistic task when using digital libraries/e-commerce sites/online news sites of their choice. We only mentioned our specific focus on serendipity in post-observation interviews (explained later).
The study took place in an office, with only a researcher and the participant present. The participants’ interactions with digital information environments and think-aloud verbalizations were recorded using eLecta Live screen recorder. 

Participants were asked to think aloud during the task, ‘telling me constantly what you are doing and why.’ During the task, participants were asked to bookmark any information they thought was useful (or likely to be useful in the future). 

We analysed our data through a partly inductive and partly deductive process. Our inductive process was partly informed by Grounded Theory Methodology (see Corbin & Strauss, 2008).

Our deductive process involved looking for examples in the observation data of when participants 1) were looking for information on a topic but found useful information unexpectedly on another (unrelated or partly-related topic) and 2) found useful information unexpectedly when looking for information with only a vague aim.

Since those sources were never used, we collapsed them into the category “Other”.

The second approach relies on a highly differentiated and much expanded interpretation of diversity, an integral part of a more comprehensive media policy (Nordenstreng, 1974), as illustrated in Scandinavia, Rhineland Europe and Canada.

digital media to support the formation of a public sphere, where a diversity of opinion
and information can interact, or, conversely, to function as an echo chamber that
reinforces established perspectives and opinions.

Other authors contest this public sphere scenario, suggesting that instead of
reinforcing democratic discussion, the Internet reinforces prior political views due
to selective exposure to political content (Bimber & Davis, 2003; Davis, 1999; Galston,
2003; Mutz & Martin, 2001; Noveck, 2000; Sunstein, 2001; Wilhelm, 1998). In

and Popescu (2011a) used tweeting behavior, network structure, and the linguistic
content of tweets to predict the political orientation and ethnicity of users.

Following Pennacchiotti and Popescu’s suggestion, we exploit the linguistic
dimension of the tweets. In order to predict the political orientation of users from the content shared, we first need to distinguish between political and nonpolitical tweets.
To do so, we extract representative features from the PolTrainingSet by employing
{1,2,3,4,5}-grams of words (where n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from
a given sequence of text, in this case words) and using term frequency-inverse document
frequency (Manning, Raghavan, & Schütze, 2008).

This algorithmcomputes the
frequency of a termand divides it by the inverse document frequency, a measure of
how the term is common across all documents. This measure is obtained by dividing
the total number of documents by the number of documents containing the term,
and then taking the logarithm of that quotient.
The representative features are then used to train a classification model. We
choose to utilize a Passive–Aggressive classification algorithm, an effective classifier
able to scale on a large corpus and to be updated over time (Crammer, Dekel, Keshet,
Shalev-Shwartz, & Singer, 2006)

Once all the users had been classified according to political orientation, we selected
only those users who shared at least one political tweet by extracting only nodes that
are Republican and Democrat. For each node, we select all those nodes connected
by an outbound tie and classify them as Republicans, Democrats, or nonpolitical
accounts. Based on this network (hereafter general graph), we compute the general
level of political homophily, defined as the number of outbound ties directed to users
who share political orientation, divided by the overall number of outbound ties (i.e.,
directed to users with similar political orientation plus directed to users with different
political orientation).The homophily rate ranges from 0 to 1.

To separate Democratic tweets from the Republican, we apply a similar approach.
We train a passive–aggressive algorithmon the features extracted by using the words
contained in the DemRepTrainingSet and compute the term frequency-inverse document
frequency

In order to assess the statistical significance of the homophily rates in the three
graphs (general, nonsymmetric interest, and symmetric social graph),we compare the
rates with a baseline homophily (Wasserman & Faust, 1994).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Researching echo chambers on Twitter, but finding out the political orientation of users by analysing the content they posted with machine learning techniques (so not only network analysis but also analysing and classifying content)"

(above) the average score of news outlets. We partition news outlets into three categories, labeling
a Republican-leaning outlet as one for which SSource
j is half a standard deviation (across outlets)
below the average score, and similarly for Democratic-leaning (above the average). All other news
outlets are referred to as centrists. People tended to click on pages from news outlets with scores close to their own: The absolute

studies. The freedom of media, a multiplicity of opinions and
the good of society are inextricably connected (Napoli, 1999). Free
Press theory, a theory of media diversity, states that we establish
and preserve conditions that provide many alternative voices,
regardless of intrinsic merit or truth, with the condition that they
emerge from those whom society is supposed to benefit its individual
members and constituent groups (van Cuilenburg & McQuail,
2003). What is good for the members of the society can only be discovered
by the free expression of alternative goals and solutions to
problems, often disseminated through media (Napoli, 1999).
While many scholars from different disciplines agree that information
diversity is an important value that we should include in
the design of institutions, policies and online services, this value
is often reduced to a single definition, such as ‘‘source diversity’’,
or ‘‘hearing the opinion of the other side’’.

Following Napoli (1999), we may distinguish three different
dimensions of information diversity. The first dimension is source
diversity, which is diversity in terms of outlets (cables and channel
owners) or program producers (content owners). Content diversity
consists of diversity in format (program-type), demographic (in
terms of racial, ethnic, and gender), and idea-viewpoint (of social,
political and cultural perspectives). The third dimension, exposure
diversity, deals with audience reach and whether users have actually
consumed a diverse set of items.

Karppinen (2009) argues that the aim of media diversity should
not be the multiplication of genre, sources or markets, but giving
voice to different members of the society.

McQuail and van Cuilenburg (1983) propose to assess media
diversity by introducing two normative frameworks. The norm of
reflection checks whether ‘‘media content proportionally reflects
differences in politics, religion, culture and social conditions in a
more or less proportional way. The norm of openness checks
whether media ‘‘provide perfectly equal access to their channels
for all people and all ideas in society. If the population preferences
were uniformly distributed over society, then satisfying the first
condition (reflection) would also satisfy the second condition
(equal access).",Yes,"One media outlet (i.e. one newspaper, one TV channel, one social media platform)",,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public),Exposure perspective (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} consumed by the audience, i.e. what they read, view, click on; more focussed on what is displayed to the individual)",,"Related to actors or entities (e.g. the diversity of politicians mentioned in the media, diversity of organisations),Related to outlets/sources (e.g. number of different media sources),Other, namely:",minority diversity,,,source diversity,output diversity (diversity of what is shared),,No,,,,,,,,,,,,Twitter,,Yes,"Related to actors or entities (e.g. the diversity of politicians mentioned in the media, diversity of organisations)",,,,,,,Network Analysis,,No,,,,,,,,Yes - look up the source in the references and copy the doi (or other identifying information if not present) here,Shannon (1948);van Cuilenburg and van der Wurff (2007);,Yes - Copy the formula (including explanation of the variables) or the description of the mathematical procedure here,Formula on page 409,No,,"While translating the concepts introduced in the previous subsection
into metrics, we apply the following entropy formula used
by van Cuilenburg and van der Wurff (2007) to measure traditional
media diversity, which is based on the work of Shannon (1948):

In van Cuilenburg and van der Wurff (2007), pi represents the proportion
of items of content type category i. n represents the number
of content type categories. We use this formula for calculating
source diversity and exposure diversity in our Twitter study. For
instance in source diversity, pi represents incoming tweets from
seed users with a specific political stance, while n represents all
possible categories. As a result of this formula, the user will have
a diversity between 0 and 1, where 0 represents minimum diversity
and 1 represents maximum diversity. Fig. 1 shows a user that
receives equal amount of tweets (20) from all political categories
and has an incoming diversity of 1. The user only retweets from
one political category (10 from Category 1), therefore she/he has
an outgoing diversity of 0.

For this definition of diversity, we first defined all seed users who
belong to a political party that is either not represented in the parliament,
or is represented with few MP’s. We also included MP’s of
a large political party who belong to an ethnic minority. That
makes for instance the Kurdish Party BDP and its MP’s a minority
in Turkey, while we consider the Greens as a minority in the Netherlands.
See Appendix A for a list of minorities. Both users defined
as minorities create about 15% of the all observed tweets for both
countries.
We then looked whether the user is receiving minority tweets
directly or indirectly.

B. We defined two metrics to measure minority access. We first
look at the ratio of minority tweets a user gets out of all minority
tweets:
# received minority tweets
# all published minority tweets ð2Þ
We later calculate the ratio of minority tweets in a users’ timeline
# received minority tweets
# received tweets from seeds",Related to outlets/sources (e.g. number of different media sources),,,,,,,Network Analysis,,No,,,,,,,,Yes - look up the source in the references and copy the doi (or other identifying information if not present) here,see above,Yes - Copy the formula (including explanation of the variables) or the description of the mathematical procedure here,see above,No,,"
We have selected different
types of users including mainstream news media, journalists,
individual bloggers and politicians. The list of these ‘‘influential’’
users were picked up from different ranking sites. For the Dutch
ranking, we used Peerreach,4 Twittergids5 and Haagse Twitterstolp.
6 For Turkish ranking, we used TwitterTurk7 and TwitterTakip
This resulted in two lists for Turkey and the Netherlands, both
containing seed users categorized in political groups, which differed
per country. We mapped the political leaning of Dutch seed
users into five groups and the political leaning of Turkish seed
users into nine groups. We did this using a number of public
sources (Carkoglu & Kalaycioglu, 2007; Krouwel, 2008;
Trendlight, 2012; van der Eijk, 2000). Later, we defined some of
the seed users as a ‘‘minority’’. We did this by selecting seed users
who belong to a political party that is either not represented in the
parliament, or is represented with few MP’s. We also included MP’s
of a large political party who belong to an ethnic minority. That
makes for instance the Kurdish Party BDP and its MP’s a minority
in Turkey, while we consider the Greens as a minority in the Netherlands.
See Appendix A for a list of minorities. Both user groups
defined as minorities create about 15% of the all observed tweets
for both countries.


For each user, we used Eq. (1) to calculate his/her source diversity.
For a user A, we compare the tweets published by A’s direct followees
(people A follows) from different groups of which the political
leanings have been categorized as discussed above (See Fig. 2).
This gives us a user’s direct input entropy. We then also added the
tweets A gets through retweets and investigated if A receives more
diverse information through indirect media exposure (See Fig. 3).
This provides us a user’s indirect input entropy. In both of figures,
arrows show the information flow.","Other, namely:",,,,,,,Simulation Study,,No,,,,,,,,Yes - look up the source in the references and copy the doi (or other identifying information if not present) here,see above,Yes - Copy the formula (including explanation of the variables) or the description of the mathematical procedure here,see above,No,,"To measure what the user is sharing after she/he was exposed to

scales from  to  representing the API’s degree of belief that the text pertains to that category.

Next, to classify news outlets into liberal, conservative, or center, we consulted the website

scores of media sources [] that is widely used for comparing media bias across different
outlets []. The ADA score measures a media outlet’s political bias based on the number
of times the outlet cites various think-tanks and other politically-oriented groups. The
score is on the scale from  to , where  indicates a strong conservative tendency. Four
media outlets (Fox News, Chicago Tribune, U.S. News &World Report, andWashington
Times) were classified as right-wing, five (including CNN) as center, and fourteen (including
Huffington Post, NPR News, and New York Times) as left-wing. As we are interested
in how different political opinions reach users having different political views, we chose to
focus on left and right media outlets ( in total), since they have a clear political stance.

a consistent tug of war between two contrasting ideological camps – market
approach versus cultural approach. The market model believes that free-market
competition among a plethora of news media more efficiently serves media
diversity, while the cultural model argues that governmental intervention is
unavoidable to achieve the goal of media diversity (Entman and Wildman
1992).

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in its Biennial
Regulatory Review (2003) identifies five categories of media diversity that are
related to media ownership policy: diversity of viewpoint, programme, outlet,
source and minority/female ownership. Viewpoint diversity relates to the availability
of a diverse range of media content that reflects a variety of perspectives
from social groups. The availability of an extensive range of views is essential to
a healthy democracy and vibrant public debates. Rules limiting concentration of
media ownership are generally deemed to be in the public interest because they
prevent a few individual owners from exercising excessive impact on public opinion
(McCann 2010)

Program diversity refers to the availability of a variety of programming
formats and contents. In an open media market with free entry, free competition
can promote program diversity

Outlet diversity is linked to the presence of multiple and independently
owned broadcasters.

Napoli’s (1999) typology suggests something different about media diversity
than the FCC. According to him, media diversity is composed of three
components: source diversity, content diversity and exposure diversity

Hoffmann-Riem (1987) articulated four dimensions of media diversity:
formats/issues, content, person/group and geographical diversity.

Drawing on the literature,
this study pays attention to two common dimensions of media diversity:
outlet diversity and content diversity. Channel diversity can be enfolded
in outlet diversity, and programme and viewpoint diversity can be included

literature by examining two under-researched yet equally pertinent effects of partisan
selective exposure: (1) the reduction in the number of societal issues that individuals
consider important (i.e., nominal agenda diversity) and (2) the reduction in the diversity
of issues that individuals consider important (i.e., thematic agenda diversity).

Nominal agenda diversity was developed as an
extension to the original agenda-setting hypothesis. It is formally defined as the ‘number
of problems held to be important by the individual, without a consideration of what
should be done about them or the intensity of their importance’ (Allen & Izcaray, 1988,
p. 33)

Conceptually, thematic agenda diversity differs from nominal agenda diversity because
it focuses on the absolute number of issues that are considered important.

This is
characterized as having high thematic agenda diversity, which is defined as the ‘semantic
variety of issues on the agenda of a particular social unit’ (Peter & de Vreese, 2003,

study utilizes two measures: the Hirschman–Herfindahl Index (HHI) and the Deviation
Index (DI). In our study, the HHI measures the degree to which genres, authors, or
topics are concentrated or dispersed within a country sample. It is calculated for each
news outlet by squaring the average percentage for each variable and summing the total.3 In the U.S.’s Los Angeles Times, for example, 91.0 percent of all print authors
are journalists, 6.5 percent are wire copy, 2.5 percent are non-journalists, and 0 percent
are unaffiliated. Squaring each percentage and summing the total provides a highly
concentrated HHI score of 8,329.5. This score is then averaged with the average scores
of the country’s other two news outlets to create a national HHI score.

The highest
possible score is ten thousand and indicates total dominance by a single element type;
the lower the score, the greater dispersion of elements across the country sample. We
use the DI (Hellman 2001), an indicator of differentiation, to measure the deviation in
the specific mixture of genres, topics, or authors between outlets in a country sample.

The DI is calculated by subtracting the averages (in decimal form) of a given variable’s
categories (such as news, opinion, and deliberation for “genre”) in one outlet
from the corresponding averages in another outlet and then summing the differences

The highest possible score is 2.0,

These themes are divided into ‘pro-election’ and ‘reform before elections’ themes. The period of observation is from advance voting day (26 January 2014) to Election Day (2 February 2014).

The cursory exploration of the different election-related themes on Facebook shows that audiences of partisan Facebook pages were indeed exposed to very different information about the election. This partially supports the echo chamber effect because it hints at a lack of discrepant information ‘within’ the network of the partisan pages.

For the collection of data the Facebook application Netvizz (Rieder 2013) was used, which allows to extract all user interactions with a particular Facebook page. Users as well as posts therefore become nodes in a graph, while likes, comments and shares become the edges between the nodes. Netvizz allows the extraction of up to 999 previous posts from any given Facebook page.

Although other metrics for the polarization of social networks are being discussed (Guerra et al. 2013, June), the most common one is still the modularity score (Newman 2006; Conover et al. 2011). Modularity refers to the actual number of connections (edges) between members of a community (module) within a social network, minus the expected number of such edges if they were randomly distributed (Newman 2006). The value ranges between −0.5 and 1, with higher values indicating a clearer segmentation into clusters that have many internal but few external connections (Newman 2006). The overall modularity score of the whole network is 0.755, indicating a very strong segmentation. At the same time, the individual Facebook pages have low modularity scores, as indicated in Table 1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Looks at echo chambers on Facebook (but mostly by qualitatively/cursory inspecting content on pages)

Philip Napoli argues that diversity in broadcasting is a “central com- ponent” in the successful operation of a marketplace of ideas; without diversity, we cannot expect wide citizen engagement with a wide variety of ideas.16 Napoli outlines three strains of media diversity: diversity of media sources, diversity of exposure to media, and diversity of content. Content diversity provides a useful lens for studying the regulation and output of the digital television system.

Content diversity refers to the programming choices and the variety of ideas available to viewers.

Local content was determined using program names and descriptions. Examples of local programs include 1st Look NY and New York Nightly News on WNBC-DT2.

The specific content analysis method that was applied in these studies is called the Network analysis of Evaluative Texts (NET) method (Van Cuilenburg et al., 1986), a method for Semantic Network Analysis (SNA) (Krippendorff, 2004). 

The amount of attention paid to political parties in the news was measured by counting the number of nuclear sentences with a political party or any of its politicians in the nuclear sentence. The political parties were sorted into four categories. Coalition parties contained all parties that formed the coalition government prior to the election (see Table 1 for an overview of which parties belonged to the coalition government in which elec- tion year). New parties were defined as those parties that gained seats in Parliament for the first time in this year’s election or in the previous election. Structural opposition par- ties are those parties that never took part in a coalition government. All other parties were considered opposition parties.

To assess the diversity of news coverage of political parties and issues dimensions during the Dutch general election campaigns from 1994 to 2012, we used the concepts vertical diversity and horizontal diversity as described by Hellman (2001). Vertical and horizontal diversity for both political actors and issue dimensions are evaluated by means of the norm of open diversity.
Vertical diversity with regard to party and issue dimension coverage was measured by calculating the entropy in number equivalents, a measure of open diversity indicating the number of parties or number of issues dimensions which receive a substantial and equiv- alent amount of attention in a group of news media (television versus newspapers) (Kleinnijenhuis, 2003).1 The advantage of this measure is that it can be interpreted intui- tively, as it represents the number of parties across which a newspaper distributes its attention (Takens et al., 2010). This means that diversity reaches its optimal level when the attention is distributed equally among all categories. With four categories of political actors, actor diversity can range from one through four. Likewise, with five dimensions of political issues, issue diversity can range from one through five.

Horizontal diversity was measured by calculating the entropy in number equivalents across all groups of news media.2 This open diversity measure is based on the proportion of the total amount of attention that each of the parties or issues received across news media. Because of the differences in the attention distribution between news media, the level of horizontal diversity does not automatically equal the average level of vertical diversity of the individual news media. If, for example, half of the news media paid equal attention to five issue dimensions, while the other half of the news media paid equal attention to five different issue dimensions, the level of vertical diversity would equal five, while the level of horizontal diversity would equal 10. So, horizontal diversity represents the number of parties or issues receiving a substantial and equivalent amount of attention within the news media system as a whole.
Horizontal diversity of party types is also evaluated in terms of a reflective norm. This is done by comparing the relative news attention for each party type with the relative power base of these parties in Parliament prior to the elections.",Related to topics (e.g. sports or politics or economics),,,,,,,"Content Analysis (quantitative, manual or (semi-)annotated )",,No,,,,,,,,Yes - look up the source in the references and copy the doi (or other identifying information if not present) here,See above,No,,No,,"See above

The categorized editorials were then recoded into 14 categories: “government and public institutions,” “re- gional and local government,” “legislation,” “national defense and foreign po- licy,” “politicians and parties,” “campaigns and elections,” “economy, finance and business,” “labor, unions and consumers,” “transport, environment and energy,” “education,” “justice and police,” “health, housing and social poli- cies,” “culture, society and others,” and “international policy.”

To measure the homogeneity/ heterogeneity of editorial topics, we used Shannon’s H entropy index as an indicator of diversity. We recoded the 41 codes of the variable “topic” into 14 major subject areas and analyzed multi- ple responses based on the total number of editorialized items in order to ob- tain fractions totaling 100%, (a requirement for the calculation of entropy).

Consequently, a key focus of the content analysis is the news peg that is used to establish the story. Generally speaking, even editorials and features peg their narratives to an event, angle, or overarching theme that justifies the story’s relevancy and draws readers in (Wilkins 1993). News pegs were deter- mined by examining the title, subtitle, and first paragraph of the article to determine the initial emphasis of the item.

Race options for reporters and sources were either ‘‘White’’ or ‘‘Non-White’’ with a space to identify the specific race (Asian, African American, Hispanic, American Indian and Alaska Native, or Native Pacific Islander2). Gender was either male or female. The study especially focused on the race and gender of sources, and especially on citation to women and non-White sources who are docu- mented to be underused in coverage.

The use of nonpartisan sources is also a focus for this study. Nonpartisan sources could include polling experts, political observers, think tank com- mentators and ordinary people, among others. In other words, such sources reflect an especially diverse mix of perspectives and experiences beyond ‘‘the usual’’ partisan sources one would expect in election coverage. Nonpartisan sources, by contrast with the partisan ones, did not on-air endorse either the Republican or Democratic presidential candidates.

his article takes a slightly different ap- proach and analyzes statutory and legal documents that assume that “diversity” actually has a workable definition and can be achieved as a virtue alone.

One question that has not yet been explored herein is what type of diversity is optimal in mass communication. As discussed previously, there is great difficulty for policymakers or researchers who wish to ef- fectively operationalize the term or measure it effectively, notwithstand- ing the fact that some attempts have been made in other fields of law.147 Is diversity achieved when women, minorities or non-corporate entities own media outlets, or when any media owner delivers programming that features characters or commentators from various demographic groups? Is diversity achieved when as many cultural, social, religious or political viewpoints as possible appear in the mass media? Is diversity a matter of content quality or quantity? 

 There may very well be a difference between di- versity of scale – as measured by the sheer quantity of media outlets, and diversity of scope – which must be inferred from patterns of qual- ity in content.166 These high-level questions of “what is diversity?” in the modern media landscape must be answered before jumping straight into regulatory strategies for achieving it

There is an important difference between viewing diversity as an in- stitutional value, which can be virtuous, and viewing it as an achievable policy goal, which can be perilous.",Yes,'The news' or 'the media' in general without any further specifications,,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public)",,No dimensions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Talks about how lawmakers tried (and failed) to define and measure diversity over the years.

Source categories were constructed based on two studies that focused on either climate change (Brossard et al., 2004) or a national health care crisis (Logan et al., 2004). We first included medical expert, government, and medical company source categories because they were commonly used in both studies. Also, following the cross-cultural study’s example (Brossard et al., 2004), we included politicians and laypeople source categories. Some source categories used in the two studies were excluded in the present study because they were either too context- specific (e.g. environmentalist) or too narrow (e.g. medical school student). Finally,we added a new international source category because H1N1 was a global pandemic that was covered widely at the global level.

Then, Chi-square tests were performed to detect associations with dominant news frames (RQ2) and sources (RQ3) of H1N1 news stories by the two countries, and dominant news frames across different issue attention cycles within each country (RQ4). Addition- ally, standardized residuals were used to determine whether each of the cells in the cross-tabulations was significantly different from its comparisons. According to the criteria of Agresti and Finlay (2009), standardized residual score greater than 92 was considered to be a criterion value of statistical significance.

In our study, system diversity is defined as the open diversity of program supply by all channels aiming to reach the general public (McQuail, 1992; Roessler, 2008). 

First, as measures of system diversity are primarily based on relative distributions of categories, they fail to account for absolute increases or decreases. Second, because diversity measures are often composite measures based on relative distributions, they fail to show which specific constituent category (i. e., program type) is responsible for the change in diversity. Moreover, even changes in the relative distribution across program types over time may not be revealed in changes in the level of diversity2.

The noon edition typically sums up the most important issues covered by the daily newspapers. The evening edition reports on further devel- opments during the day and overlaps considerably with the evening news on the national television channels. Summaries of news stories were used for coding. They contain a list of news stories with a few lines on the content and the names of actors appearing in newscasts. In order to ensure the accuracy of these summaries as a coding source, they were compared to the full manuscripts as well as to tapes of actual broadcasts. Although not every single actor appearing in the news could be registered based on the summaries, there was no evidence of systematic differences across time or type of group. Stories about news from abroad were not coded since they feature very few Danish interest groups.

If the same actor appeared in two news stories it was registered twice, and different groups appearing in the same story were registered individually. Groups interviewed or cited were always coded, while groups mentioned in passing or, for example, criticised by other actors were coded if the story focused on these groups as constituting a news element. Thus, if the story included two opposing views, groups representing each view were registered. If, on the other hand, a story started by referring to a past group statement and focused on the reaction of another group, only the latter group was coded.

The diversity index registers the share of attention to the three types of groups with the lowest share. Pearson’s correlations are calculated based on the share of appearances in each of the twenty years included. Levels of significance: * = 0.05; ** = 0.01; *** = 0.001.

In order to capture the extent of diversity in group appearance in a single figure, the diversity index adds the share of attention granted to the three types of groups with the lowest shares.

Do audience members actually view, read or hear the diversity supplied by media? 

Yet, diversity that is only sent but not received cannot have the positive effects attributed to a diverse media supply. More research on the conditions that foster or inhibit the reception of diversity is therefore necessary (Napoli, 1997).

Taking up this call, this article presents a first exploratory take on the important but hitherto neglected concept of diversity as received.

Diversity is ‘one of the foundation principles in communications policy’ (Napoli, 1999: 7). It is defined as the heterogeneity of media content on one or more dimensions (McQuail and Van Cuilenburg, 1983).

Frequently investigated dimensions include TV programme type and news topic. From a democratic perspective, the variety of political ideas expressed in media is of special interest. Such idea diversity (Napoli, 1999) is an impor- tant condition for well-informed decision-making and an expression of a healthy democ- racy (McQuail, 1992).

Respon- dents were asked how frequently they discussed politics with (a) people who hold political views very different from their own (M D 2.6, SD D 1.7), (b) people with extreme right views (M D 2.2, SD D 1.6), (c) people with extreme left views (M D 1.5, SD D 1.6), and (d) people of a different social status (M D 2.3, SD D 1.8). The final scale was calculated using the approach used by Scheufele, Nisbet, Brossard, & Nisber (2004). Respondents’ self-placement on the ideological spectrum was used to recalculate the frequency of political talk with ideologically likeminded others to ‘‘0.’’ That is, a left-leaning person who discussed politics with others from the left would receive a ‘‘0,’’ and similarly for a right-leaning respondent. The items tapping frequency of discussion with an individual of a different social status and ‘‘different political viewpoints’’ remained unchanged because they measured heterogeneity directly. The final variable was calculated by taking the mean of the four items (M D 1.8, SD D 1.2 Cronbach  ̨ D .70, higher values indicate greater Discussion Network Heterogeneity).4

Three items were employed to establish exposure to ideologically dissimilar news media. One item asked respondents to place themselves on an 11-point political ideology scale, as described above. The second item asked the respondent to place the ideology of the ‘‘leading mass media in Colombia’’ on a similar scale (M D 5.6, SD D 2.0). In addition, respondents were asked about the frequency with which they obtained news from nine sources (e.g., radio, national daily papers, news magazines, national network news, and television programs about current events, among others), and the mean of these 9 items was calculated (M D 2.1; SD D 1.0; Cronbach  ̨ D .70). To create the final Dissimilar News Media Exposure scale, the personal ideological position was first subtracted from the media position and the absolute value, which captures the distance between the media’s perceived ideology and that of the respondent, was computed.

Opinion diversity refers to the distribution of public opinion along a continuum ranging from homogeneity to heterogeneity. McDonald and Dimmick (2003) suggest that diversity be con- ceptualized as a two-dimensional construct, subsuming quantity of categories, and evenness of distribution. Following this view, perceived opinion diversity could be considered as high when one believes that there are many competing viewpoints coexisting in the real world (dimension 1) and that membership of any opinion group is not overwhelmingly outnumbered by other groups (dimension 2).

To build theoretical connections between the use of different media outlets and one’s perception of opinion diversity, we conceptualize perception of opinion diversity as the end result of two sources of influence: one stemming directly from individuals’ exposure to pluralistic or monopolistic media messages; and the other from individuals’ own opinion extremity which is also a likely function of media exposure.",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,No,,"As noted earlier, pluralistic media messages offer a range of confrontational views on issues in cover- age, thus making it possible for the audience to be aware of the presence of controversy and rationales for alternative viewpoints; in contrast, monopolistic media messages emphasize orthodoxy of thoughts and therefore favor the closure of the universe of discourse",Yes,'The news' or 'the media' in general without any further specifications,,"Exposure perspective (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} consumed by the audience, i.e. what they read, view, click on; more focussed on what is displayed to the individual)",,Related to viewpoints or perspectives (also includes: frames; whether it includes conservative or liberal positions),,pluralistic media messages,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,The media (market) in general,,Yes,Related to viewpoints or perspectives (also includes: frames; whether it includes conservative or liberal positions),,,,,,,Survey,,No,,,,,,,,No,,No,,No,,"Exposure to pluralistic media messages. Exposure to pluralistic media messages was not measured directly but inferred from exposure to four Internet applications. These Internet applications are carefully chosen based on the following two criteria: (a) each Internet appli- cation should accommodate pluralistic views and (b) exposing to any of these Internet applica- tions is likely, if not unavoidably, to result in exposure to pluralistic views. he use frequency of each of these applications, including Internet forum (M = 1.59, SD = 1.13), personal blog (M = 1.18, SD = 0.59), news search with search engine (M = 1.65, SD = 1.19) and instant messaging (M = 2.62, SD = 1.79), were measured by a 5-point scale (1 = never use; 2 = 1 or 2 days a week; 3 = 3 or 4 days a week; 4 = 5 or 6 days per week; 5 = use daily). Exposure to pluralistic media messages (M = 2.80, SD = 1.77) was then calculated from the use of these Internet applications. Here, instead of calculating the mean frequency of use, we operationalized exposure to pluralistic media messages as the highest frequency of exposure to any one of such Internet applications, on the assumption that one exposes himself or herself heavily to pluralistic messages as long as he or she frequently uses any one form of such Internet applications and that one does not exposes himself or herself to pluralistic viewpoints only when he or she does not use any one form of such Internet applications.

Additionally, this study takes into account the number of newspaper titles per million (m) inhabitants",No,,"Diversity of the media system. In order to operationalize the diversity of a media system, this dimension can be divided into the range of media products and the concentration of the media market. For measuring the first subdimension, the number of daily newspa- pers and the number of TV channels (domestic or foreign with a local advertising window) are gathered. The number of TV channels seems to be a better measure than the number of TV stations because it can be easily applied to countries with a TV network system and to those without. For measuring the concentration of media markets, most studies rely on the density of newspapers (Voltmer, 2000: 17–18). This is usually calculated by the number of newspaper copies per thousand (k) inhabitants. Additionally, this study takes into account the number of newspaper titles per million (m) inhabitants which, in our opinion, reflects the concept of diversity in a more accurate way.6 Both measures have the advantage that they include the size of a country, at least in terms of its population size.
Furthermore, a common approach to measuring the concentration of a national media market is followed. In general, the concentration ratio for the five (or rarely 10) largest media outlets is calculated (Djankov et al., 2003; Hughes and Lawson, 2005). Accord- ingly, in this article, the five largest daily newspapers of each country are identified in order to add their market share based on circulation. Analogically, the market share of the five largest TV channels based on viewing time is added. These figures are combined to create an average index of concentration for each country.
Even though this approach has proven its value, it is not without problems. First, the market share of media products tells us nothing about the market share of the adjacent media outlet or about content diversity. Second, it is generally complicated to accurately define the relevant market (here: viewing time or circulation) in order to calculate dif- ferent market shares.
The data sources used in this context are the annual publications of the World Asso- ciation of Newspapers (WAN) (2009) and the International Marketing Committee (IP) (2008). They had to be complemented by single-state analyses where data were missing (e.g. Gomez Garcia and Sosa Plata, 2009). Although their data collections meet high professional standards, WAN and IP themselves have to rely on national data sources (e.g. newspaper associations or market research institutions). Therefore, some deductions in equivalence and reliability have to be accepted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Looks at diversity at the market level (concentration, number of media outlets).

The original nominal-level data were transformed to ratio level by using percen- tages based on story time length. Each story or segment was timed in seconds and, as a result, each broadcast had a cumulative total length in seconds. This allowed for a pooled total (in seconds) of each variable category per broadcast. To produce an overall baseline percentage average, this number was divided by the total number of pooled seconds for each respective sample population. For stories using multiple sources, the total time of the story (in seconds) was divided by the number of on-air sources used. 

The actual length of a story and the proportional amount of exposure to an on-air news source is a key point of relative emphasis within a broadcast (see D. K. Scott et al., 2008). Cumulatively, a weighted approach will correct distortions reflected by the FAIR studies that ‘‘counted sources.’’ Finally, the creation of ratio-level data allows for a more robust statistical procedure.

External pluralism describes “the exist- ence of a range of media outlets or organizations reflecting views of different groups or tendencies in society.”6 Therefore, it is closely related with PPP; the higher the external pluralism in a particular media system, it is expected that PPP will be higher. On the contrary, PPP is expected to be low when internal pluralism, which is pluralism within each individual media outlet, is high. In accordance with PPP defined through newspaper readership patterns, internal pluralism refers to the divergence of votes for parties within a group of particular newspaper readers, while external pluralism demarcates the variance in newspaper preferences within a group of particular political party supporters.

Finally, an important factor concerning the question of diversity and pluralism is their dual nature (Benhamou and Peltier, 2006). On the one hand, there is the diversity offered, that is the spectrum of choices offered to the public.

Our definition of a ‘topic’ is that of an event that occurred in a specific spatiotemporal context. A ‘topic’ becomes a ‘story’ or an article after it has been recounted as such by journalists (Esquenazi, 2002; Ringoot and Rochard, 2005). A topic is much broader than a story, in the sense that it can be approached through different angles or mental frames, but still refers to the same facts. By proceeding in this way, we can embrace the spectrum of issues referred to by French-speaking web sources on a given day. This classification gives us the opportunity to measure the number of articles dedicated to each of them.
We carried out the operation of classification through a semi-automated and induc- tive method. First, we applied a software of textual statistics, Lexico, to our corpus of article headlines in order to identify repeated phrase segments. This step allowed us to spot the most redundant topics in our data. The counting of single words, mostly names of individuals or countries, was also used to isolate some frequent topics that were not visible in repeated phrase segments because the wording of headlines differed from one source to another.
In a second step, after eliminating duplicates, it was necessary to carry out a manual categorization of headlines into less frequent topics. Such a method raises the question of arbitrariness. Nevertheless, this solution appeared to be the least biased since the nature of editorial content does not allow a purely automated categorization. This initial treatment led to the creation of a database including three parameters: the name of the web source, the article headlines that it published and the topic to which each article referred.
The two main criteria we used in order to measure the pluralism of information in our data are those of variety and balance. Variety in this case depends on the number of topics that we isolated in our sample of headlines. Balance depends on the number of headlines per topic.","Other, namely:",,,,,,,"Other, namely:",linguistic analysis,Yes,No,,,,,,,No,,No,,No,,"In order to do so, we used two different measurements to examine both the degree of diversity and redundancy for each source. The first measure was based on repeated seg- ments of text that we isolated in our database of headlines, using the software Lexico. The existence of frequent repeated segments in the headlines of articles is a marker of redun- dancy. It results from the repetition of the same stereotypical phrases in the headlines that were published by our sources sample. Although headline resemblance does not always mean that the content of the articles is identical, it is a strong sign of editorial redundancy. The second measure was based on hapax, that is words that appear only once in our data- base. The existence of hapax in headlines is a marker of lexical diversity. This lexical diver- sity indicates some degree of editorial pluralism, although this is not always true given that journalists can use different words to cover the same topic. The combination of these two measures provides additional evidence on the issue of diversity and redundancy from the point of view of the production of original headlines (or, on the opposite, of the recurrence of their wording). Thus, the third level of analysis takes into account the degree of diversity of the language used by news websites.

Specifically, this research created a measure of content diversity to make these comparisons. Measures used to define content diversity were (1) the diversity of topics, (2) the use of outbound hyperlinks and (3) the inclusion of multimedia and interactive elements.

Diversity is typically measured by analyzing the diversity of sources present within articles, diversity of staff present within newsrooms or diversity of media information sources or ownership located within a geographic region. This research contributes to diversity literature by examining the diversity of content. Voakes et al. (1996: 585) defined content diversity as ‘a dispersion of the representation of ideas, perspectives, attributions, opinions or frames within a news product, and within the context of one particular issue.’ Content diversity is distinct from source diversity because the inclusion of a diversity of sources does not always equate to a diversity of ideas in articles.

Authors from the Project for Excellence in Journalism (1999) argued that the more topics covered by the news organization, the better the news organization. They claimed a diversity of topics better reflects a community in its entirety.

This study employed a quantitative content analysis of articles from English-language daily newspaper and citizen journalism websites in the USA. This investigation was restricted to newspapers that had an online presence and did not include websites for radio and television outlets. Newspaper websites were preferred to radio and television news websites because online newspaper sites are greater in number and geographic diversity.
Some of the topics stemming from the 2005 Project in Excellence in Journalism coding protocol were used in this study. Topics included news media, technology, Gulf War II, entertainment, business/economy, crime/trial, science, inter- national/foreign relations, education, disease/health, government/elections, lifestyle, environment/sprawl/transportation, accident/disaster, human interest and other/can’t tell. Coders identified topics by determining the greatest percentage of text within an article devoted to the subject.

Simpson’s D was computed to measure publication diversity (Simpson, 1949). Simpson’s D is calculated by summing the squared proportions and subtracting the sum from 1. It is considered an optimal measure for diversity due to its interpretative capability (McDonald and Dimmick, 2003). The measure for diversity ranges from 0 to 1. A higher number denotes a greater level of diversity. Online newspapers had a diversity level of .839 with 480 articles and online citizen journalism publications had a diversity level of .869 with 482 articles. Thus, online citizen journalism publication topics were slightly more evenly distributed than online newspapers.

Coders noted whether articles contained or linked to video, audio, slideshows, photographs, information graphics, graphics, maps and polls. An article could possess more than one of these elements. As mentioned earlier, visual stand-alone content was simply not coded in order to make the data more manageable; however, it was coded if the story carried a textual caption.

According to independent t-tests, online newspapers (.19) were significantly less likely to link to outside content than were online citizen journalists (1.1). Instead, online news- paper journalists (.57) were more likely to attempt to keep users at their sites with the use of within-site links than citizen journalists (.38).

Online citizen journalists were significantly more likely to use more photos (.54), graphics (.06) and polls (.02) in their articles based on the results of independent t-tests (p < .05).

As framing involves the construction of views in both news production and consumption processes, the concept appears to be a proper analytical tool to examine the relationship between media content diversity and audience issue cognitions.

Research on frame diversity is limited, but a few studies have examined agenda diversity.

Although pluralism and diversity are used interchangeably in this chapter it is worth going through some definitions of the concepts to establish why the lack of these ideals in a highly concentrated media market might be an issue of public concern. A broad definition of media diversity has been provided by Hoffmann-Riem (1987) who referring to the broadcasting scene a couple of decades ago distinguished four dimensions of diversity. For him there must be diversity of formats and issues, meaning that all the various fields and topics - entertainment, information, education and culture - have to be taken into account. Secondly, this should be complemented by a diversity or plurality of contents. This means that programmes should provide comprehensive and factual coverage of the different opinions expressed in a society. Thirdly, person and group diversity must exist. Programmes have to cater for the interests of all parts of the community. The main point here is access, but also representation. Finally, Hoffmann-Riem pointed out that broadcasters should include local, regional, national and supranational content. To sum up, a programme has to ensure that issue, content, person and geographical diversity is provided.

A similar identification of the dimensions of diversity has been provided by McQuail (1992: 144-5) who argued that the media can contribute to diversity, firstly by reflecting differences in society, secondly by giving access to different points of view, and thirdly by offering a wide range of choice.

one also needs to distinguish between external and internal diversity. The former, according to McQuail (1992: 145-7) refers to media structure because it is related to the idea of access. It relates to the degree of variation between separate media sources in a given sector, according to dimensions such as politics, religion, social class, and so on",Yes,The media market overall (e.g. not related to specific media outlets),,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public)",,No dimensions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Yes - look up the source(s) in the references and copy the doi (or other identifying information if not present) here,Independent Study on Indicators for Media Pluralism in the Member States – Towards a Risk-Based Approach (2009),"Excessive media concentration can endanger media pluralism (the presence of a number of different and independent voices)

The Diversity Index (US) and the integrated communications market (Italy)
A new approach to assessing viewpoint concentration in local media markets was adopted by the FCC during its third biennial ownership review. This Diversity Index (DI) was introduced to provide ‘its media ownership frame- work with an empirical footing’ (FCC, 2003: 46316). The Commission was responding to claims increasingly voiced both by the courts (e.g. Fox v. FCC, 2002: 1048) and scholars (e.g. Napoli, 1999) that media ownership regula- tions targeted at non-economic goals such as media diversity need to be jus- tified by empirical proof, and that traditional justifications no longer suffice.

There is, however, neither a consensus on what constitutes plurality (e.g.is it a plurality of owners, a plurality of channels and titles and variations within them, or a diversity in content/ideas), nor on how this goal can adequately be achieved, let alone empirically measured.

The German Commission on Concentration in the Media (KEK), the regulatory body responsible for ensuring a diversity of opinion in national broadcasting, entered new ground in the course of its review of the proposed merger between ProSiebenSAT.1 Media AG and Axel Springer Media AG by developing a new weighting approach that takes account of possible influences of various media on the diversity of opinion (KEK, 2006)",Yes,The media market overall (e.g. not related to specific media outlets),,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public)",,No dimensions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,No,,"Media plurality is a political goal and there is a far-reaching consensus in democracies that it should be maintained so as to guarantee a free and diverse communications landscape.

Among them, the question concerning their contribution to diversity is of predominant importance at the macro level of research. ‘Diversity has been the most potent concept in communication policy in modern times and in some degree remains so’ (McQuail, 2007: 41). Among the many normative concepts in mass communication research, diversity is probably the most prominent one. When Denis McQuail revisited this concept in 2007 he underlined the ambiguities of the concept as well as its continued importance. Diversity can be an end in itself but it can also be a necessary requirement to attain what society requires. 

When new media emerge, the level of diversity is expected to increase. At the levels of ownership, content, receiver/audience and channel, additional mass media might increase diversity.

All these public service features relate closely to the value of diversity. On the content level, quality and diversity are the key features together with requirements to respect minorities and foster national culture and identity (Syvertsen, 2003: 157), as well as the provision of news to enable citizens to participate in the democratic process in an informed way (Steemers, 2001: 126)",Yes,More than one media outlet (in different sectors; this also includes aggregating platforms such as Google News),,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public)",,"Related to outlets/sources (e.g. number of different media sources),Other, namely:",,,,ownership diversity,"content diversity (kind of article, multimedia included)",,Yes,Not reported,,No,,,,,,,,,Newspaper (online),,Yes,Related to outlets/sources (e.g. number of different media sources),,,,,,,"Content Analysis (quantitative, manual or (semi-)annotated )",,No,,,,,,,,Yes - look up the source in the references and copy the doi (or other identifying information if not present) here,"van der Wurff, 2005",No,,No,,"Following the examples of earlier research (van der Wurff, 2005), a content analysis of all 30 online media was conducted during a week (Monday to Friday) in summer 2006, this included not only the home page but also pages from all sections such as international news, politics, economy, regional news, faits divers.

Diversity has long been an important measure of the quality of any media system in democratic societies (Einstein, 2004; McQuail, 1992; Napoli, 1997). According to Napoli, the concept of media diversity has three major components: (1) source diversity, (2) content diversity, and (3) exposure diversity (see Table 1). Source diversity is defined in terms of media ownership as well as by the diversity of its workforce. Content diversity refers to the multiplicity of viewpoints, program types and the demographic profiles of those represented in media content. Exposure diversity measures how audiences make use of the available options. While each of these three prime components is an indispensable ‘link in the diversity chain’ (Napoli, 1997, p. 18), exposure diversity is considered the most important element in the pursuit of a marketplace of ideas.

In his media diversity model, Napoli (1999) further categorized diversity of exposure into two types: horizontal diversity and vertical diversity.

These panels are created through a process of multi- stage area probability sampling, in which each stage is stratified and sample elements are drawn in proportion to their incidence in the population. The CSM peoplemeter is an electronic device attached to the TV set that automatically records the minute- by-minute viewing behavior of all the members of the household. Such meters are known to produce a much more precise record of viewing behavior than either diaries or telephone recall techniques and have become the preferred method for measuring television audiences worldwide (Webster et al., 2006; refer to Appendix A for a sample of original peoplemeter data).

In the current study, audience polarization was measured as the audience’s total time spent viewing the channel divided by the total time spent viewing TV, i.e. share-within-cume.

Following the precedent of the Beijing study (Yuan & Webster, 2006), the current study operationalized channel repertoire as the total number of channels viewed for 10 or more consecutive minutes at least once during the week, or Primary Channel Repertoire (PCR).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Looking at exposure diversity of television viewers in China.

The News Diversity standard takes frame diversity as a central criterion for evaluating the role of news media in shaping democratic politics. The standard needs to be complemented by further theorization and empirical studies. Meanwhile, I suggest that the model presents a typology (below) of the form of news segments as a concrete operationalization of the concept of frame diversity. 

I modify Schlesinger, Murdock and Elliot’s (1983) typology and propose classifying the form of news stories according to the following categories:
1. Restricted: when only one interpretive frame of the political event or issue is presented by the news story
2. Plural-closed: when more than one interpretive frame of the political event or issue is presented by the news story, but the frames are arranged in a hierarchy so that one is preferred over the other(s) and presented as more valid/true
3. Plural-open: when more than one interpretive frame of the political event or issue is presented by the news story, but treated within a more indeterminate relation where no interpretation is preferred

The Diversity Index extended and modified the HHI in a number of ways. The FCC described the methodology as follows:
In terms of calculating the Index, within each medium we combine commonly- owned outlets and calculate each owner’s share of the total availability of that me- dium. We then multiply that share by the share of the medium in question in the total media universe (television plus newspaper plus radio plus Internet). Once these shares in the overall “diversity market” have been calculated, we add together the shares of properties that are commonly-owned (e.g., a newspaper and a television sta- tion), square the resultant shares, and sum them to get the base Diversity Index for the market in question.

If audiences concentrate more highly on a small number of items, even when they have many choices, policies, and arguments for outlet diversity and format diversity would be unjustified. 

Similar notions have been mentioned by others. Napoli (1999) introduced the construct exposure diversity referring to how many different items audiences select. This idea is distinguished from source diversity and content diversity (McQuail, 1992; Napoli, 1999, 2001).

For Switzerland, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung was chosen as an elite, liberal daily newspaper with an opinion-leading function (readership: 8.4 percent). Artificial weeks with forty-two issues per year were created to draw a sample of 399 articles out of the entire media coverage on biotechnology (Bonfadelli et al. 2001). 

In parallel to the increase in public attention, there was also an increase in the diversity of media frames The frames with rather positive valuations of biotechnology (progress, economic prospects) lost weight and were complemented by frames with rather nega- tive valuations (e.g., public accountability, ethical).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Content analysis data from another study (without any further explanations) are used to look at frames.

to in most democratic countries, is considered to be of crucial value and a
central objective of communications and media policy. Media diversity refers
to media content; media diversity is heterogeneity of media content in
terms of one or more speciﬁed characteristics. Variety in news media supply,
for instance, may be measured in terms of distribution of attention across
news categories, political stances, news genres, cultural foci, and so on. This
deﬁnition of diversity is a ‘product deﬁnition’ and as such is not without
policy implication, because it focuses on media content rather than on media market structure and media organizational conduct. Thus, this
deﬁnition avoids a too easy equalization of the number of media outlets to
media performance, e.g. we do not suppose there is a simple positive
connection between competition and diversity. It remains to be seen
whether more media competition really brings about more media variety. 

Two faces of diversity: reflection and openness

Often, media practitioners and politicians think that more media diversity is
‘better’. This. however, is not the case: media diversity always has to be
externally gauged in some way or manner. Gauging, or benchmarking,
should be based on the existing social diversity that media are reporting on.

Put differently, media diversity should always be compared with relevant
variations in society and social reality. Two different normative frameworks
present themselves (McQuail and Van Cuilenburg, 1983).4 Do the media
relate to society in such a way as to reﬂect, pro rata, the distribution of
preference, opinion, allegiance or other characteristic as it appears in the
population? Or is the content distribution within the media such that
perfectly equal attention is given to all identiﬁable preferences, streams, or
groups, or positions in society? If the ﬁrst scenario is the case, the media
adhere to reﬂection as the norm for media diversity: media content
proportionally reﬂects differences in politics, religion, culture and social
conditions in society in a more or less proportional way. If the second
scenario holds, then media performance satisﬁes the norm of openness, that
is, media uniformly, in arithmetically absolute terms, provide perfectly equal
access to their channels for all people and all ideas in society.

Reﬂection in media diversity is depicted in Figure 2 with a purely
hypothetical example. The population curve in Figure 2 represents the
distribution of preferences in the population, e.g. political opinions, religious
beliefs or interests in particular kinds of news, or any other relevant
population characteristic. We assume that population preferences will
correspond with a certain kind of demand for media content. The other
curve, the media curve, represents the media supply, complementing
population preferences and characteristics. Ideally, in the case of maximum
proportional media reflection of population preferences and characteristics,
both curves fully coincide. The example in Figure 2 shows, however, that media preferences only partly overlap with population preferences, indicating
a media deﬁciency in reﬂection.


Figure 3 portrays media supply compared to media supply under the
condition of full openness, i.e. equal access for all preferences in the
population, be they majority or minority preferences or characteristics.
Graphically, equal access, or full openness, may be represented by a uniform
distribution, as in Figure 3: the straight horizontal line indicates that no
category of preference or characteristic in the population gets more media
coverage, attention, and supply than any other preference or characteristic
category. Consequently, open media diversity is, at the same time,
mathematically the maximum diversity media systems can realize.

There is a dialectic relationship between reﬂective (proportional) and open
(uniform) diversity. As both ﬁgures taken together make clear, only if
population characteristics, preferences and conditions are fully horizontal,
that is, uniformly distributed over society, does reﬂection coincide with
openness. This, however, is seldom the case. More often than not,
population characteristics and preferences tend toward the middle; toward
normal distributions, toward mainstreams, so to speak. Media ratings and
research from commercial media research generally show large homogeneity
of actual media preferences and media use in the population. This fact
implies that media reﬂecting society inevitably ill perform regarding
openness to a great variety of different social positions and conditions,
whereas perfectly equal media access harms majority positions in favor of
minority beliefs, attitudes and conditions. There is no easy way out from
this dilemma: proportional reﬂection and uniform openness can hardly ever
both be fully realized at the same time.

So, in studying diversity and new media one should raise the question
whether, and to what extent, the Internet and other new carriers and
communication outlets do indeed increase and enhance social, political and
cultural expression (reﬂective diversity) and discussion and debate (open
diversity) in society.

Many theorists suggest that diversity best ﬂourishes in a free marketplace 9‘
ideas: if people can freely enter this marketplace to exchange information
and opinions, without any constraint by government or any other party,
then we may expect cultural variety and diversity to happen.

Diversity will only result from a marketplace of ideas if the number of
different providers of information is large and competition between them is
full and fair, so that power dominance does not exist. We also have to
assume that ‘buyers’ of information are fully and rationally informed about
the marketplace. That is, the market is transparent, so that citizens may get a
clear concept of what information in media markets is available to them. 

The diversity paradox stems from the dialectics between reﬂective and
open diversity (see Section 3). With informatization of society and the
increase in media outlets, media diversity has indeed reached an unimaginable
level: it is very difﬁcult to specify types of contents which are nowhere
available in media markets. However, media markets are far better at
producing proportional reﬂection of majority civic interests and consumer
preferences (Figure 2), than in equal, uniform openness to political and
cultural innovations, stemming from minorities and new groups in society
(Figure 3).

Competition may indeed favor media quality,
but it is reﬂective diversity that gains most by competition.

Some hypotheses on competition and diversity
The relationships between different forms of media competition and media
diversity may be expressed in the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1 Media competition and content hypothesis (derived from
Hotelling).

The more media compete for marketshare, the more they compete on price
(Cr) (ﬁerce competition), the less they compete on content (Ci) (moderate
competition).

The more media diversity is reﬂective diversity (DI), the less media diversity is
open, equal access diversity (DU)

The more media compete for marketshare, the more they compete on price
(C1,), the less they compete on content (C), the more media diversity is
reﬂective diversity (Dr), and the less media diversity is open diversity (Do).

So, if democracy presupposes diversity, and diversity itself is being promoted
by competition, we really should adhere to a free marketplace of ideas. We
have seen, however, that the connection between these variables is far from
simple.

In many southern countries, of course, large sections of the media audience may experience very limited access to some, if not all, media platforms. Significantly, then, an inversion of the view from which to assess media diversity is required in developing countries. 

 It is one matter to measure the diversity of content within a particular print media publication, but the importance of that analysis must be jointly determined by the accessibility (in addition to the availability) of the publication to a specific audience.

Therefore, on assessing media diversity of content in southern countries such as South Africa, the audience must necessarily first be segmented into the varying media bundle categories (once these have been identified), and a media type should preferably be included within an audience segment’s media bundle only if its access and accessibility are rated highly for that particular audience segment. Only then can a content analysis of the level of diversity within the media be initiated, but a separate content analysis should be done for each media bundle category.

Van Cuilenburg (2007, 38–39) makes a case for assessing the diversity of a media market in its entirety, as opposed to analysing the diversity of separate media markets in isolation from one another.

Therefore, if the primary motivator for measuring media diversity is a concern for the diversity of content and available ideas according to which audiences form opinions, it may be better to view the media as a whole, rather than as separate parts. 

 Indeed, the ideals for media diversity held by policy-makers may not necessarily reflect any symmetry with the preferences of the audience(s). Therefore, as part of the project of establishing a media diversity measurement tool, an audience study becomes essential.

The means suggest media weblog posts (M = 6.1, S.D.=4.14) employ more diverse frames than non-media weblog posts (M = 4.1, S.D. = 2.58), although this difference is only marginally significant, F = 3.9, p < .10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Type of blog (media vs non-media),,,,,"Group comparison (e.g. t-test, F-test)",,,,,,Yes,,1,media weblogs,2,non-media weblogs,3,,4,,5,,6,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Operationalize diversity (which they also do not define at all) as number of frames used.

Without ensuring diversity of views in media content and programming, it is impossible to guarantee ‘an increase in the diversity of content consumed by audiences’ (Napoli, 2003, p. 129).

Source diversity has attracted the attention of policymakers who have attempted various strategies to practically implement the elusive principles enshrined in the concept.

For this purpose, there are two types of pluralism which, a priori, guarantee the freedom of information: internal and external pluralism. External pluralism refers to the diversity of media organisations and the contents that express the different points of view of a society. This means that pluralism emerges from the variety of companies (public or private), media (printed, broadcast, digital, etc.) and contents that express different editorial lines. On the other hand, internal pluralism occurs within each media organisation, and refers to the diversity of points of view that are included in the news content of each media organisation and reflect the search for neutrality, content balance, and cultural diversity.

A conceptual contribution to the definition of both types of pluralism was made by the Council of Europe (1994) in its fourth European Ministerial Conference on mass communication policy in a democratic society: “Pluralism can be internal, across a wide range of values, opinions, news stories and interests that find a vehicle of expression in the bosom of a particular media sector, or external through some of these bodies, each of them expressing a particular point of view”.",Yes,"One media outlet (i.e. one newspaper, one TV channel, one social media platform),More than one media outlet (all in one sector)",,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public)",,Related to viewpoints or perspectives (also includes: frames; whether it includes conservative or liberal positions),,Perspectives,,,,,Yes,Not reported,,No,,,,,,,,,"Other, namely (please fill in)",Television,Yes,Related to viewpoints or perspectives (also includes: frames; whether it includes conservative or liberal positions),,,,,,,"Content Analysis (quantitative, manual or (semi-)annotated )",,No,,,,,,,,No,,No,,No,,"The level of pluralism has been addressed through a variable that measures the presence/absence of different perspectives on the same news item.

This allowed us to determine whether there is over-representation (or underrepresentation) of certain issues at two levels: across the news programmes of the different networks (external pluralism) and within each network -internal pluralism-.

In the event of the existence of external pluralism, the analyses should show differences between networks with respect to the distribution of topics, i.e. if all the networks give the same importance to the same topics then the residuals will be close to 0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Looks at internal and external pluralism on the television market in Spain.

As Junge (1994) noted, the first dimension of diversity is categorical and is typically a set of discrete classifications within a given distribution. The second dimension is the allocation of the elements to the categories. Conceptually, then, diversity becomes an interaction of the number of categories with the assignment of elements to those categories. Mathematically, interest is in the flatness of the distribution (Pielou 1975).

When considering the diversity of the media agenda, there are at least three different uses of diversity: source diversity, content diversity, and audience exposure diversity (Napoli 1999). Source diversity can mean both the number of media owners and the number of media channels. Content diversity refers to the category designations given to different program formats, issue categories, people’s demographic features, and viewpoints represented within the media. Audience exposure diversity refers to the content diversity that audiences are really exposed to in their media use. Media agenda diversity is an important measure over time because it can influence public opinion diversity and fundamental values of democracy.

In this study, content diversity is measured with subject content (issue categories) that the newspaper reports on, which is also called media agenda diversity.

As discussed earlier, diversity is a dual-dimensional concept. This study used Simpson’s (1949) D to measure diversity because it is flexible and sensitive to both dimensions (McDonald and Dimmick 2003). Simpson’s D is obtained by summing the squared probability (the pi values) from all the categories and subtracting that sum from 1 This measure is more straightforward and easier to interpret, and is especially useful
in simple descriptive studies of one single measure of diversity (McDonald and Lin 2004).

Diversity of outlets requires that space be allocated to users on different communication platforms to ensure that the general public is able to receive a diverse range of broadcasting services.36 In order to promote diversity of outlets, it is recommended that there should be at least three categories of broadcasting services: commercial; commu- nity, and public service.37 Although the programming format of these broadcast- ers is not mutually exclusive, their operating rationale is different. Thus, where all the three types of broadcasters are in operation, this will maximize the promo- tion of dissemination of a wide range of information and ideas catering for the informational needs of a diverse audience.

The second facet of diversity, which relates to sources, demands that adequate measures be put in place to prevent monopolies in the media.47 The protection of freedom of expression under international law obligates states to prevent undue media dominance or concentration by privately controlled media groups in monopolistic situations that may be harmful to a diversity of sources and views.4

The guarantee of freedom of expression imposes an obligation on the state to take steps to promote diversity of media content.61 Programming by broadcast- ers should provide diverse views, opinions, and perceptions to the public they serve.

Specifically, diversity in the news is maintained both internally and externally. Internal pluralism is defined as pluralism achieved within each media organization, where media outlets maintain neutrality, and avoid strong institutional ties to both social and political groups.

In the media studies literature, the concept of pluralism has primarily been used in a dichotomous sense. Although the concept of media pluralism can be treated on various levels and is also interpreted through many dichotomies or alternatives, the fundamental distinction on which all others are based is between external and internal pluralism. According to Gibbons (1998: 31), external pluralism refers to the ‘diversity of media sources’, whereas for Hallin and Mancini (2004: 29), external pluralism is the kind ‘achieved at the level of the media systems as a whole, through the existence of a range of media out- lets or organizations reflecting the points of view of different groups and tendencies in society’. Klimkiewicz, however, claims that Hallin and Mancini’s definition of external pluralism might better suit the concept of structural media pluralism, given that ‘[t]he external/internal dichotomy has been drawn from the perspective of a single media orga- nization, not the media system as a whole’ (Klimkiewicz, 2010: 907).
Internal pluralism pertains to the level of the ‘diversity of media contents available to the public’ (Klimikiewicz, 2009: 46) or to the ‘pluralism achieved within each individual media outlet or organization’ (Hallin and Mancini, 2004: 29). There is greater consensus regarding the level at which internal pluralism occurs. 

in Doyle’s view, internal pluralism pertains to the diversity of the output (referring to the media content), whereas external pluralism refers to the diversification of media ownership (Doyle, 2002).",Yes,The media market overall (e.g. not related to specific media outlets),,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public)",,No dimensions,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,The media (market) in general,,Yes,No dimensions,,,,,,,"Other, namely:",Market analysis and analysis of sanctions,No,,,,,,,,No,,Yes - Copy the formula (including explanation of the variables) or the description of the mathematical procedure here," The HHI index is calculated by summing the squares of the percentage of shares held by the respective companies in a given market.",No,,"Thus, this analysis will examine the media pluralism regulations currently in force in the two countries as well as the existing situation of the TV markets.

The final aim was to assess the differences in the quality of internal pluralism in the two countries by analyzing the type of offenses committed and sanctions imposed in the broadcasting sector. The inquiries and proceedings that occurred over the course of two years, between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009, by the governing bodies whose primary function is to monitor and ensure the respect for pluralism, the Office of Communications (Ofcom) in the UK and the Authority for Communications (Agcom) in Italy, were compared.

After examining the normative frameworks within the two countries, attention is now paid to the media structure and to the effects of these regulations. Table 1 provides an overview of the media context in the British TV market between 2008 and 2009.

This l-diversity constraint brings a brand new challenge to D-MobiFeed, i.e., the trade-off between relevance and diversity of news feeds.

After that, the l-diversity constraint checker decides whether the system could compute news feeds from the candidate messages for u’s query regions at t0, t1, . . . , tn, such that messages in each news feed belong to at least l categories. This l-diversity constraint checking is referred to as a decision problem. Finally, the news feed scheduler generates n + 1 news feeds satisfying the l-diversity constraint, and their total relevance score is maximized.

 l-Diversity Constraint Checking (DCC) Problem: Given a user u’s news feed query and a look-ahead step n, D- MobiFeed decides whether it could schedule at most k messages for each of n + 1 news feeds, such that messages in each news feed belong to at least l categories.

Minimum Total Diversity (γ): Given a set of n + 1 news feeds and an l-diversity constraint, the minimum total di- versity (γ) is the sum of (1) the maximum number of categories (which is less than l) of a news feed that cannot satisfy the l- diversity constraint and (2) the minimum number of categories (which is equal to l) of a news feed that can satisfy the l-diversity constraint. If every news feed can satisfy the l-diversity constraint, γ = l × (n + 1). However, if at least one news feed cannot satisfy the l-diversity constraint, γ < l × (n + 1).",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Measuring the diversification of news feeds using some complex mathematics, but not really measuring the diversity of news media or the media market, so should rather be excluded.

Both media plurality and media pluralism are thought to be essential for democracy, since the media industry has an important weight in the political process, due to the considerable influence it can have on the public opinion.

In order to analyze the relationship between market structure and media pluralism, we adopt the standard model of media pluralism, the Hotelling model (see Gabszewicz et al. 2001).

The trade-off between getting as much relevance as possible and avoiding totally irrelevant recommendations links to the duality of risk vs. returns in portfolio theory [58], and is represented in our context by complementary metrics for one aspect and the other: recommendation accuracy metrics for evaluating total degrees of relevance (seen as an absolute magnitude), and diversity metrics that assess relevance robustness to changing contexts (considering relevance as a relative property). Rather than using two complementary measures, it is also possible to combine both perspectives (diversity and accuracy) into a single metric by restricting the measurement of diversity to only the relevant recommended items (disregarding the variety of irrelevant ones). We propose two new metrics that assess pure diversity (to which we shall refer as inter-sys- tem diversityand relative diversity), and we select an additional one from prior work that accounts for relevance and diversity together (named a-nDCG by its authors [19]).

A direct way to measure diversity is by computing the average self-information of recommended items.

One method might be to adapt something like the Herfindahl-Hirschmann index (H index) of market concentration from economics, defined as the sum of squares of the percentages of the market share held by all of the firms in a market. The highest possible score is 10,000, where one firm holds 100% mar- ket share (1002 = 10,000), and the lowest would approach zero, where a large number of firms each hold tiny shares of the market. Thus, by analogy, if a particular story line or framing completely dominated every media outlet (i.e., held a 100% share of the market- place of ideas on that matter), a News Homogeneity Index (NHI) might equal 10,000, denoting perfect homogeneity. If the framing of a matter differed substantially in every national media outlet, an NHI might be close to zero, denoting almost perfect diversity.

The NHI can vary from +10,000, where every story on every network supported all four dimensions of the White House frame and none supported the opposition frame, to −10,000, the opposite case. A score of zero on the NHI might be considered optimal, as it would represent equal presence of both frames and, in the context of the baseline expecta- tion of homogeneous support of the White House frame, a significant instance of punctu- ated homogeneity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Makes a news heterogeneity index and applies it to a sample case.

Next, Napoli’s components and subcomponents are used to review to- day’s situation in Mexican television

In many policy debates, source diversity is seen as the most important factor to fos- ter diversity in the mass media. According to Napoli (1999), this dimension has been traditionally conceptualized by policymakers in three separate ways: ”(a) in terms of the diversity of ownership of content or programming, (b) in terms of the diversity of ownership of media outlets, and (c) in terms of the diversity of the workforce within individual media outlets” (p. 9)

According to Napoli (1999), content diversity has three different subcomponents: format or program-type diversity, demographic diversity, and idea-viewpoint diversity.

According to Napoli (1999), the concept of exposure diversity is divided into two components: horizontal diversity and vertical diversity.

Consider the notion of cultural diversity, a well-established manifestation of the diversity principle in the communications sector (UNESCO, 1995, 2002). According to UNESCO (1995), cultural diversity is defined as
the manifold ways in which the cultures of groups and societies find expression. . . . Cultural diversity is made manifest not only through the varied ways in which the cultural heritage of humanity is expressed, augmented, and transmitted through the variety of cultural expressions, but also through diverse modes of artistic creation, production, dissemination, distribution and enjoyment, whatever the means and technologies used. (Article 4, no. 2)

This concern about “national diversity” (i.e., the extent to which a multitude of national cultures remain vibrant and resistant to submersion beneath a few dominant cultures; see Norris & Engelhart, 2008) is persistent—and perhaps even intensified—given the greater challenges to limiting the cross-border flows of content that characterize the contemporary media environment.

The term user-focused diversity is being employed here to capture the more granular analytical lens that is finding its way into diversity policy discourse. The sphere of diversity policy is extending beyond its traditional, institutionally-focused boundaries, thereby incorporating concerns that have long resided at the margins of mainstream diversity policy priorities.

However, two subconcepts of diversity, that of access and choice for the audience, are the two notions that have been placed high on the agenda of regulators and policymakers when considering media concentrations. Regarding diversity of access, the key question is whether the possibility of establishing new media companies leads to the situation where all legitimate interests in a given society have an equal (or proportional) share of access to media channels. Regarding diversity as choice, the key question is whether an increase in channels actually leads to greater choice for the audience.

Diversity of Ideas.
Diversity of Products.
External andInternal Diversity

Since the market model encourages the proliferation of channels and new audience markets, it can lead to increased numerical diversity, that is, more channels and theoretically more consumer choice.

The diversity principle extends, in part, from the traditional dem- ocratic theory notion of a well-functioning ""marketplace of ideas,"" in which citizens' abilities to participate effectively in the democratic processare contingent upon their abilities to consider a wide array of ideas and viewpoints from a wide array of sources (Napoli, 1999b; Sunstein, 1993). Diversity concerns have economic moti- vations, as well, since policymakers have sought to maximize the choices available to media consumers, thereby increasing their overall satisfaction (Entman & Wildman, 1992; Napoli, 1999b).

For the ""marketplace of ideas"" to enhance citizen knowledge and the consideration of diverse viewpoints, citizens must be exposed to diverse points of view (Napoli, 1999a).

Belief that diversity can be absolute or linear value is easy enough to repudiate. It might seem that all things plural, diverse and open-ended are to be automatically regarded as good. But as McLennan (1995) has pointed out, in deconstructing it, we are faced with questions of the following order: Is there not a point at which healthy diversity turns into unhealthy dissonance?

Similarly, while media diversity clearly denotes heterogeneity on some level, it can be defined in any number of ways and it can refer to any aspect of the media: sources, outlets, opinions as well as genres and representations. In debates on media policy, di- versity can refer to the extent which media contents reflect and serve various interests and opinions of the public, or it can refer to the general diffusion of media power in society on the level of ownership, economic structures, and political influence. Consid- ering the variety in possible definitions of diversity, empirical evidence on the relations of different aspects of diversity tends to be very ambiguous too

As Van Cuilenburg (1998) puts it, media diversity al- ways has to be ’gauged’ in some way to the variations in social reality. The question arises then, how to conceptualize this relationship. How are the differences against which diversity is examined constructed, institutionalized and operationalized?
Here, most studies follow McQuail’s (1992: 144-145) conceptualization, in which the media is seen to contribute to diversity in three ways: (1) by reflecting existing differ- ences in society, (2) by giving equal access to any different points of view, or (3) by offering a wide range of choice for individuals. Each of these implies a different inter- pretation on the meaning of media diversity and the standard by which it should be as- sessed.

Van Cuilenburg (1998: 41) has presented some of these problems in ‘diversity paradoxes’, contradictions between the aspects of diversity that cannot be reconciled. For instance, more reflective diversity usually goes with less diversity in terms of equal access for all groups. Similarly, the explosion of information increases choice but also bring along waste and overload of information. Even though the expansion of channels might lead to increased choice, there is no cor- responding effect on the citizens’ access to relevant information. On the contrary, in- crease in the diversity of supply may reduce the actual consumption of diversity (expo- sure diversity) (Gibbons, 2000: 308-311; Van der Wurff, 2004: 216).

In any case, the interpretation of diversity in terms of programme types or genres has consequently become the common focus of both scholarly and policy debates on media diversity (van der Wurff 2004: 216).",Yes,'The news' or 'the media' in general without any further specifications,,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public),Exposure perspective (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} consumed by the audience, i.e. what they read, view, click on; more focussed on what is displayed to the individual)",,"Related to viewpoints or perspectives (also includes: frames; whether it includes conservative or liberal positions),Related to topics (e.g. sports or politics or economics),Related to outlets/sources (e.g. number of different media sources)",,diversity of opinions,programme-type diversity,structural diversity/diversity of ownership/outlets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Yes - look up the source(s) in the references and copy the doi (or other identifying information if not present) here,Chantal Mouffe (2000,"Does pluralism mean that anything goes?

Even the best known proponent of ‘radical pluralism’ in political philosophy, Chantal Mouffe (2000), explicitly denies the type of extreme plu- ralism that valorises all forms of difference and espouses heterogeneity without any lim- its, because for her, such pluralism crucially misses the dimension of the political. Be- cause of its refusal to acknowledge the relations of power involved in the all ‘construc- tions of differences’, such naïve pluralism is actually compatible with the liberal eva- sion of politics, converging with the typical liberal illusion of a pluralism without an- tagonism (ibid: 20).",Yes,'The news' or 'the media' in general without any further specifications,,Not specified,,No dimensions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Uses pluralism and diversity mostly interchangeably.

unique text codes that represented 64 different story topics.

 “Diversity” is the number of differ- ent topic areas within a content category. For example, the news content category may print stories covering topics about business, crime and court and city government.

Starting at the individual story level, the computer program identified the topic of each story from its URL link containing the specific code, and then counted the num- ber of words in that story. Altogether 64 story topics over the course of 10 years were aggregated into four broader content categories: news (17 story topics), sports (24 story topics), features (15 story topics) and community service (eight story topics).38 For example, in the aggregated category of sports content, there were stories on hockey, college football and high school sports, among other sports-related subjects. The research director of the newspaper agreed that our aggregation of story topics reflected the general categorization of content in the newspaper.

In the Matter of 2002 Biennial Review, Report and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (2003), at 19, available at <http:llwww.fcc.gov/ DailyReleases/DailyBusiness/2003/db07O2/FCC-03-127Al.pdf> (last visited July 9, 2003).
","In the Notice of Inquiry published pursuant to the first [1998] Biennial Regulatory Review, 5 the Commission placed diversity at the forefront in defining the framework for review. It recognized three types of diversity: (1) viewpoint: ""helping to ensure that the material presented by the media reflect a wide range of diverse and antagonistic opinions and interpretations,"" (2) outlet: ""a variety of delivery services (e.g., broadcast stations, newspapers, cable and DBS) that select and present programming directly to the public,"" and (3) source: ""promoting a variety of program or information producers and owners.""6

In the Report
announced on June 2, 2003, the Commission recognized five types of diversity, reflecting changes in thinking on diversity since the first [1998] Review. (1) Viewpoint diversity ""refers to the availability of media content reflecting a variety of perspectives. A diverse and
robust marketplace of ideas is the foundation of our democracy. ' 30
(2) Programdiversity means ""a variety of programming forms and content""-for example, drama, comedy, news, reality shows, and sports for television.31 In 1998 program diversity had been considered a part of (3) source diversity, which refers to ""availability of media content from a variety of content producers. Program diversity was not thought to require extensive justification. ""[W]e expect program diversity to be best achieved by relying on media companies responding to consumer preferences. 35 (4) Outlet diversity, ""in a given market, there are multiple independently owned firms, '36 is used to measure viewpoint diversity.
The Commission reaffirmed (5) advancement of minority and female media ownership as an important diversity objective. It described several creative proposals and expressed an intent to issue a Notice of Proposed Rule Making.38

Three measures were used to determine diversity. A ""Diversity
Index"" developed by Dominick and Pierce 134 indicates ""the extent to
which a few categories dominate prime time.' 135 ""Vertical diversity""
is a sign of concentration of genres in the overall schedule, and
""horizontal diversity"" evaluates viewer choice of genre in the same 36
time period.1

The Commissioners introduced a statistical measure to justify the cross-owned combinations, the Diversity Index (DI). The DI is
modeled on the Herfindahl-Hirshmann Index (HHI), which is a tool used to analyze concentration in a given industry. A high HHI value is an indicator of high concentration.

diversity across total news coverage is provided by the Herﬁndahl index, which has been used
fruitfully by cultural sociologists to measure homogeneity (e.g., Dowd et al., 2002; Batman,
2006). I use the Herﬁndahl index to measure the extent to which news coverage is concentrated or
dispersed relatively evenly across the sixteen institutional ﬁeld categories (“institutional
concentration index"" or ICI) and 10 immigration—related ideological frames (“frame
concentration index"" or FCI). The index is calculated simply by squaring the percentage
that each institutional ﬁeld or frame appears in a given newspaper (relative to all ﬁelds or frames
appearing in its news coverage) and then summing the total. The highest possible score is 10,000
(indicating total dominance by a single frame or ﬁeld, i.e., 100 x 100); how low it goes depends
on the number of categories in the model, but the lower the score the more even the dispersion of

G. McDonald and Dimmick (2003); G. M. McDonald and Lin (2004); Chem et al., 2003; Johnson & Wanta, 1993; Lacy, 1987; McQuail, 1992; Voakes et al., 1996","D. G. McDonald and Dimmick (2003) and G. M. McDonald and Lin (2004) criticized previous studies of media diversity for being just descriptive in nature. They argued that statistically significant differences in mean values cannot accu- rately reflect the true diversity. These researchers proposed that media diversity measurement should incorporate two dimensions (Junge, 1994; D. G. McDonald & Dimmick, 2003; G. M. McDonald & Lin, 2004). The first dimension is the number of categories, and the second is the proportion of objects distributed to these categories. Thus, for example, in a study of newspaper content diversity, a set of discrete classifications of news content is the categorical dimension, whereas the second dimension is the percentages of each classification.
D. G. McDonald and Dimmick (2003) and G. M. McDonald and Lin (2004) proposed that measurement of media diversity should consider the interaction of these two dimensions. These researchers support a more appropriate statistical test that advances beyond descriptive studies of diversity. They pointed out that the measure of diversity (a) should vary between 0 and 1.00 (0 indicates no diversity and 1.00 indicates the highest degree of diversity), (b) should consider the condition where no population members are assigned to additional categories (in such case, the value of diversity should not be changed.), and (c) should be able to partition variance within the measures to assess contributions of other variables to diversity or statistical differences (G. M. McDonald & Lin, 2004). This study employed Simpson’s D, which has these three characteristics (D. G. McDonald & Dimmick, 2003; G. M. McDonald & Lin, 2004), to test newspaper diversity.

This study assesses newspaper diversity from the perspective of “subject con- tent,” using 20 categories from prior studies (Chem et al., 2003; Johnson & Wanta, 1993; Lacy, 1987; McQuail, 1992; Voakes et al., 1996).",Yes,The media market overall (e.g. not related to specific media outlets),,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public)",,Related to topics (e.g. sports or politics or economics),,,subject content,,,,Yes,More than one coder,2,Yes,Scott's pi,,0.75,Yes,1349,not reported,Not reported,,Newspaper (offline),,Yes,Related to topics (e.g. sports or politics or economics),,,,,,,"Content Analysis (quantitative, manual or (semi-)annotated )",,No,,,,,,,,Yes - look up the source in the references and copy the doi (or other identifying information if not present) here,"G.

M. Mc- Donald & Lin, 2004). Simpson’s D compares two groups by summing the squared probabilities from all the classifications and subtracting that sum from 1.00. It varies between 0 and 1.00, where 0 indicates no diversity (viz., all the objects are in one category) and 1.00 indicates that all of the objects are in different categories

This study followed G. M. McDonald and Lin (2004) and used two exten- sions of D to advance the comparisons. The first extension of D is referred to as Lieberson’s Db, developed by Lieberson (1969). Lieberson’s Db is used to measure between-newspaper diversity. It compares similarity of two different populations in the categories of classification (Agresti & Agresti, 1977). Lieber- son’s Db represents the probability that two randomly drawn units from each population are classified differently. If two populations have the same distribu- tions, Lieberson’s Db and D have the same figure (G. M. McDonald & Lin, 2004).

The second extension is referred to Multivariate D (Dmulti). Dmulti is used in situations in which a single population is classified according to two different variables. It represents the proportion of different classification of a pair on two variables. The third extension is known as Multivariate Db (Dbmulti). Similar to 
Dmulti, Dbmulti represents the proportion of different classification of a pair on two variables, but the pairs are chosen from two different populations (Agresti & Agresti, 1977; G. M. McDonald & Lin, 2004).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Adding new competitors to the market,newspaper type (new vs old),,,,Other,Inspecting confidence interval,Yes,,Positive influence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,Inspecting confidence interval,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Examines the diversity of the newspaper market in Taiwan using different versions of Simpson's D and looks at how the advent of a new newspaper changes the diversity etc. Diversity was seen in terms of topics/topical categories that were manually coded.

Frames are distinguished using extensive search-strings to indicate the presence of a given frame. This approach is based on one of the devices suggested by Gamson and Mogdiliani (1989) that signify the presence of a frame, namely, catchphrases, which Pan and Kosicki (1993) mention as an element of the rhetorical structure of a text. The search-strings were composed on the basis of the coding of the documents included in our qualitative analysis, complemented with a random sample of both parliamentary documents and newspaper articles. For each of these documents and articles, the coder established which frames were present and which word combinations were indicative of these frames. Although a complete frame contains diagnostic, prognostic and motivational compo- nents, we did not take that as an absolute requirement for the presence of a frame. Especially in newspaper articles, framing is often incomplete for several reasons, amongst others due to the limited length of the text.
We used our search-strings to search for all official documents presented to parliament between 1995 and 2005 that included one or more of our frames. A total of 5,376 frames were found in the sample. Our use of the same search-strings to analyse the media debate on migration and integration resulted in a total of 14,850 articles that contained a mean of 1.09 frames per article.

Thematic agenda diversity concerns the semantic variety of issues on the agenda of a particular social unit.2 Even if different social units have the same nominal diversity (i.e. name the same number of issues), their thematic diversity may differ. For example, if, at the individual level, two respondents both mention two issues, but respondent A mentions inflation and prices, whereas respondent B mentions inflation and environment, then respondent B may be considered to show a broader thematic diversity.

Third, although researchers have employed media exposure measures (Allen & Izcaray,1988; Chaffee & Wilson, 1977; Reinemann & Brosius, 1998; Wanta et al., 1995), no study to date has linked the diversity of the public agenda to the diversity of the media content individuals are actually exposed to.

However, no study to date has linked the diversity of the public agenda to the diversity of the media agenda, i.e., the diversity of the specific media content to which the public is actually exposed. We investigate the relationship between diversity on the news agenda and diversity on the public agenda by including a diversity measure of different television news programs.",Yes,More than one media outlet (all in one sector),,"Exposure perspective (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} consumed by the audience, i.e. what they read, view, click on; more focussed on what is displayed to the individual)",,Related to topics (e.g. sports or politics or economics),,,agenda diversity,,,,Yes,Not reported,,Yes,“percentage agreement” only,,0.85,No,not mentioned,not mentioned,Not reported,,"Other, namely (please fill in)",Television,Yes,Related to topics (e.g. sports or politics or economics),,,,,,,"Content Analysis (quantitative, manual or (semi-)annotated )",,No,,,,,,,,Yes - look up the source in the references and copy the doi (or other identifying information if not present) here,Shannon and Weaver (1949); van Cuilenburg (2000); McCombs and Zhu (1995),Yes - Copy the formula (including explanation of the variables) or the description of the mathematical procedure here,Shannon's H (Formula on page 52),No,,"To investigate the diversity of the media agenda, we drew on a content analysis of the most widely watched public broadcasting and private network news programs conducted for the two weeks immediately preceding the European Election day. In each of the countries, each news story (defined as a semantic entity with at least one topic delimited from another story by a change of topic) of the main evening news program was analyzed.5 The stories as units of analysis were coded by native speakers who had been trained several weeks before coding and supervised throughout the whole coding period.

To assess the agenda diversity of each of the news programs, we employed the topic category of the content analysis. The inter-coder reliability (i.e. the average percentage of pairwise agreement) for this category varied in the five countries between  percent in the Netherlands and  percent in Germany. The topics of the news stories were categorized in the same  issue categories used for the nominal and thematic agenda diversity (see above). Similar to the analysis of public agenda diversity, ‘Miscellaneous’ was dropped from the analysis, resulting in  issue categories.

In order to compute the agenda diversity for each of the television news programs, we chose the entropy measure (H-statistic) developed by Shannon and Weaver (1949). This measure is often used in research on diversity and has been employed in other studies of agenda diversity as well (Chaffee & Wilson, ; McCombs & Zhu, ). As suggested by van Cuilenburg (2000, p. ) and McCombs and Zhu (1995, p. ), we used a standardized measure so that the values range between zero and  where zero indicates homogeneity and  maximum diversity:

As can be seen in formula (), the more even the distribution across the issue categories is, the greater the diversity becomes. For example, if all issue categories receive the exact amount of coverage in terms of length within a news program, then pi has the same value for each ith issue category and consequently D will be , indicating maximum issue diversity. Because the news programs differ considerably in length (e.g., the German Tagesschau  min and the French Le Journal  min), we based our computation on the overall length of the coverage of a particular issue category during the period of investigation rather than on the overall number of stories. As formula () shows, we computed for each of the issue categories their proportional share in the entire coverage of a particular news program. The diversity scores for each news program are documented in the Appendix.

 In order to make the link between an individual’s agenda diversity and the agenda diversity of television news as tight as possible, we included in our analyses only those respondents who regularly, but exclusively watch one or both of the TV programs content analyzed

Because we focus on the relationship between television and public agenda diversity without specifying causal directions, we computed eighth-order partial correlations with the demographics, TV and newspaper exposure, number of newspapers read, attention to political news, and political interest as control variables.
As Table  shows, the diversity of the television news agenda was related to a higher nominal and thematic public agenda diversity only in Denmark. For the UK and the Netherlands (nominal diversity), the effect of television news diversity was also positive, yet not statistically significant. For Germany, France, and the Netherlands (thematic diversity), we found a weak, but not significant negative effect of television news diversity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Looks at the diversity of agendas in different newspapers in different countries and whether it is related to agenda diversity of the people (it was not).

In some cases – for instance, Issue 9 “The terms used to describe the U.S.” – we categorized the responses by whether they had a negative or positive connotation. In order to distinguish between “positive” and “negative” assessments, we used the official statements of President George W. Bush as a reference point. By “positive,” then, we mean that the given statement or phrase matched the official U.S. position, as articulated by the president. The official position was determined by a content analysis of 46 public speeches made by President Bush during roughly the same period as the content analysis of the press.

To operationalize the concept of pluralism, we measured how evenly dispersed were the press’ responses across the categories of each issue, using the “index of qualitative variation” (IQV) (Bohrnstedt & Knoke, 1994, p. 50). The IQV standardizes the level of diversity for the number of categories. In other words, the IQV allows us to compare the level of pluralism on the 10 issues, even though some of the issues comprise more categories than others. The IQV is calculated as follows:

The greater the value of IQV, the more equally dispersed are the units among each variable’s
K categories. A high IQV score means that the press offered a highly diverse set of views on the given issue. The highest value of IQV is always 1.0 whenever cases are equally spread over the categories. For instance, if a given issue related to 9/11 had four categories and an equal number of content units fell in each category, the IQV score would be calculated as follows: IQV = [1 − (.252 + .252 + .252 + .252)]/(.75) = 1.

McQuail (1992) proposes a sequential model of the process of communi- cation which implies that diversity can be analyzed in terms of media structure, media content, and media audience. The present study focuses on media content. Content diversity refers to “the variety or breadth of media content available to media consumers, with higher consumer wel- fare provided by high diversity” (Roessler, 2007, p. 467)

The question as to the optimum level of diversity is a normative one. The most widely used 􏰈 but also disputed 􏰈 measures in diversity re- search are based on equal representation of all categories under study as the ideal level of diversity; this is called open diversity (Roessler, 2007).

An alternative to open diversity is reflective diversity, which consists of media expressing ‘different ideas or topics in the same proportion as media users prefer them’ (Van der Wurff and Van Cuilenburg, 2001, p. 214).

Yet, this study focuses on open diversity, since open diversity is especially important in countries with an open multiparty system such as the Netherlands.

Content diversity in terms of the breadth of news coverage can be mea- sured at different levels: at the level of the media system as a whole (horizontal diversity) and at the level of individual media outlets (vertical diversity) (Hellman, 2001)

We will examine both forms of diversity as breadth because a low or a high level of vertical diversity is not necessarily accompanied by the same level of horizontal diversity.

(1988), which is based on Evaluative As- sertion Analysis (Osgood et al., 1956). This method has been extensively used for analyzing political (campaign) coverage (e. g., Scholten and Rui- grok, 2005; Ruigrok, 2008; Kleinnijenhuis et al., 1995, 2003, 2007). The NET method divides a text into a number of so-called “elementary statements”. These “elementary statements” describe the relationships be- tween objects, i. e. actors and issues, in the text in the form of Source: Subject / Predicate / Direction of the predicate / Object. The predicate describes the nature of the relationship between the Subject and the Ob- ject, while the direction indicates whether this is a relationship of associ- ation (􏰉1) or dissociation (􏰈1). The coding starts from an ontology, a predefined list of so called “Knowledge Objects” from which coders draw the Sources, Objects, and Subjects. The term “Knowledge Objects” is used as an overarching concept for political and societal actors, in addition to issues, which are frequently encountered in the news.
The amount of attention paid to political parties was measured by count- ing the number of elementary statements referring to a political party, or politicians belonging to this party, in either the Subject or the Object position. Attention to issues was measured by counting the number of occurrences of an issue in the Object position2. We recoded the issues into fourteen main categories. To assess the diversity of newspaper cov- erage of political parties and issues during the 2006 Dutch general elec- tion campaign, we used three different measures. These correspond with those discussed earlier as described by Hellman (2001): vertical diversity, horizontal diversity, and the degree of difference. We make a distinction between diversity of the coverage of parties and issues.

Vertical diversity with regard to party and issue coverage was mea- sured by calculating the entropy in number equivalents, a measure of open diversity indicating the number of parties or issues which receive a sub- stantial and equivalent amount of attention in a newspaper (De Ridder, 1984; Kleinnijenhuis, 2003)3. We calculated the entropy in number equiv- alents instead of the entropy per se (which can be derived by taking the log of the entropy in number equivalents) or the relative entropy, as mentioned by Hellman (2001). The reason for this is that the entropy in number equivalents can be interpreted more intuitively. It represents the number of parties over which a newspaper distributes its attention.
Horizontal diversity was measured by calculating the entropy in number equivalents across all newspapers4. This open diversity measure is based on the proportion of the total amount of attention that each of the parties or issues received across newspapers. Because of the differences in the attention distribution between newspapers, the level of horizontal diversity does not automatically equal the average level of vertical diversity of the individual newspapers. If, for example, half of the newspapers paid equal attention to five issues, while the other half of the newspapers paid equal attention to five different issues, the level of vertical diversity would equal five, while the level of horizontal diversity would equal ten. So, horizontal diversity represents the number of parties or issues receiv- ing a substantial and equivalent amount of attention within the newspa- per system as a whole.
Following Hellman (2001), the degree of difference in the distributions of the attention to parties and issues between the individual newspaper and the newspaper system as a whole was measured by calculating the sum of the absolute differences between the proportion of attention paid to parties or issues within a newspaper with the proportion of attention directed to those parties or issues across newspapers5.

construct similar or competing interpretations (Druckman, 2010; Herman, 1985). This
enables us to assess diversity at the level of interpretative repertoires referred to by the
constructed frames – distinct perspectives upon reality sustained by specific background
assumptions about the nature of the world (Donati, 1992; Wetherell and Potter, 1988). To
avoid a highly case-specific account, we introduce a deductive, theoretically grounded
category system. Identifying distinct repertoires from recurrent patterns among these

outlets to which a given media outlet is linked, that is, with how many other websites a
given website shares its audience. A higher percentage across the network indicates the
degree to which the audience is exposed to all of the available outlets. A lower percentage
means that the audience chooses particular options to the exclusion of others, the
pattern that would be expected in an echo chamber. We also calculated the network centralization
score (Freeman, 1979). This score indicates the degree to which the network
is dominated by a few websites (a star-shaped network). In such a star-shaped network,
only one website (or very few websites) enjoys a shared exposure with all or most of the
other websites, as opposed to the majority of websites that are peripheral and not linked
to other websites by a shared audience (high score: 100%). This star-shaped network
contrasts with a network in which audiences spread their attention widely across outlets,
and all of the websites are connected to each other by a shared audience (low score: 0%).
A low score, then, indicates the absence of echo chambers in the network because the
audience frequents many different websites and is not organized into cliques.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Measuring echo chambers by looking at browsing histories - using manual content analysis to get the ideology of news outlets and using network analysis to find out about audience deduplication.

News articles in front pages can be diversified using their category or topic tags.

There are algorithms for selecting a diversified set of documents among a given collection, based on measures such as maximal marginal relevance [13]. The application of such algorithms is examined in Clarke et al. [14]. Selection based on diversity is also studied in the context of publish/subscribe systems [15]. In such systems, documents are obtained in a given period of time and then a subset of them is selected by applying greedy search, to find the most diverse item. Recommendation systems that consider diversification [16] find documents of a similar interest to the user profile/query, while presenting diverse results from various topics.
In this study, we do not apply such approaches directly, since our algorithm handles different factors altogether, namely, importance, diversity and the length of the front page. For diversification, we utilize topic modelling that aims at finding latent groups/topics in a text collection.

Briefly, LDA outputs topic-word (φ) and document-topic (θ) distributions. The word distribution for topic c (φc) estimates the probability of a word being gen- erated by topic c. The topic distribution for document d (θd) estimates the probability of a topic being generated by docu- ment d. These are used for determining the topic of a document, and also the representative words for each topic. LDA learns a topic model, including these distributions, and can be used to predict the topic of a new document. However, in this study, we aim at utilizing distributions obtained from the model to estimate the importance of documents and topics.

Let the number of documents in a given text collection be M and di’s topic be c, and assume that the importance value for the document di (1 ≤ i ≤ M) is estimated by using φc of each word included in di. This measures, intuitively, di’s importance by calculating how words in di represent di’s topic. Let the topic assigned to di (i.e. highest probability in θi) bec,thenumberofwordsindi beTi,tij beawordindi (1 ≤ j ≤ Ti),andtheweightofwordtij inφc bewij.Thefunc- tion doc_imp(.) measures how important (representative) a document is for its topic

For diversification, we utilize topic modelling that aims at finding latent groups/topics in a text collection. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study adapting topic model- ling for public front-page news selection.

Having estimated topic and document importance values, we apply our priority-based method to provide diversification. Briefly, for a given front-page length, we select important news articles from various topics according to their priorities.

We create an annotation program, with a user-friendly interface, capable of providing the label importance, while main- taining the diversity of the front page. 

Similarly, let cd be the total number of virtual clusters for day d. For the annotator a, diversity of a front page of d, with length s, is diva(d)=cd=s: Then, the diversity of all front pages annotated by a is measured by the function ann_div(.):

 In previous research, two primary approaches to measuring content diversity have been applied: examining diversity of content and diversity of ownership patterns (Entman and Wildman 1992; Iosifides 1999; Van Cuilenberg 2005).

Connections drawn between these two sub-components of news diversity have been built on the assumption that source diversity will lead to content diversity in a truly competitive marketplace (Napoli 1999; Van Cuilenberg 2000). While this assumption has often proven problematic—structural diversity does not automatically ensure diversity of content—researchers have examined various sub-components of content diversity, including format or program-type, demographic and idea-viewpoints (Napoli 1999, 18–24). Measuring the diversity of idea-viewpoints within media content is often considered a form of reflective diversity, that is, a way to assess the “actual match between users’ preferences and the reflection of these preferences in media content” (Van Cuilenberg 2000, 53). Assessing the connections between reflective diversity in media content—an approach most strongly connected to a normative democratic theory of the media as being essential to maintaining a marketplace of ideas (Entman and Wildman 1992)—and ownership diversity is the central undertaking of the present research.",Yes,More than one media outlet (all in one sector),,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public)",,"Related to topics (e.g. sports or politics or economics),Other, namely:",,,,,Duplication of content,,Yes,Not reported,,Yes,“percentage agreement” only,,95,No,10318,100,Not reported,,Newspaper (online),,Yes,Related to topics (e.g. sports or politics or economics),,,,,,,"Content Analysis (quantitative, manual or (semi-)annotated )",,Yes,Yes,Other measure,,,,,Percentage agreement with a human coder on 100 articles,No,,No,,No,,"In order to answer this study’s research questions, researchers used the software Herramienta de Documentalista (HDD) to automatically download and archive RSS feeds2 of top stories posted daily to the websites of 27 Spanish-language news outlets for the five weeks leading up to the 2012 Presidential elections (10,318 articles were gathered; see Table 1).

Once the articles had been collected and stored in the software’s archives, researchers set up a number of filters, called materias within the software’s Spanish interface, that could be used to categorize the archived stories into a single topic, such as immigration, healthcare, or education.3

Regarding the reliability of the HDD software’s ability to categorize the stories into the assigned topics, the calculation of the materias (which is based on a widely used process of indexation and automatic classification) is based on the number of words that appear assigned to the particular materia (e.g., healthcare, education, immigration) and are repeated during the text. These results are then compared with a corpus of words (verbum) previously associated with the field (or materia). The software’s developer, F. D. Márquez, has published the methods used by the HDD software in a leading technological journal in Spain (Márquez 2013). Researchers relied primarily on these previously published, peer-reviewed tests of the software’s reliability. As an added test of reliability, 100 articles were randomly drawn from the sample and coded by hand; the percentage of agreement was 95 percent.

Researchers organized the data in order to show the number of stories that fell under each story topic (materia) and the percentage of the articles that these stories represented. By comparing these results with polling issues, researchers were able to provide a general measure of the overall reflective diversity of the coverage, as called for by related scholarship addressed above.","Other, namely:",,,,,,,"Content Analysis (quantitative, manual or (semi-)annotated )",,Yes,No,,,,,,,No,,No,,No,,"For the second question, which asked to what degree Spanish-language media conglomerates presented a heterogeneous array of news stories during the given time frame, the HDD software was used to measure the amount of duplication of content across outlets. For this effort, the researchers measured the number of stories assigned to each materia, the media outlet in which they appeared (diversity by outlet) and a comparison of duplicated articles (based on word-for-word duplication in both headline and content of the story) by media outlet and by materia (topic). The HDD software examines both the headline and body of a story and only flags as “duplicate” those stories that are exact copies—word for word, from the headline to the final paragraph. Once the stories had been categorized according to topic, amount of duplication, and publisher, researchers were able to create cross-tabulations of multiple criteria (e.g, the percentage of stories about immigration that were duplicated on media websites owned by impreMedia—La Opinión, La Prensa, Rumbo, Hoy, etc.).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Analyses diversity in Spanish-speaking outlets by using automated content analysis.

Briefly, the basic Simpson’s D (Dw) looks at the probabilistic occurrence of diversity of one ‘specific characteristic’ within one ‘population’. In our approach, ‘specific char- acteristics’ may refer to the causes of the Euro Crisis, for example, in which we apply Dw to determine the probability of different causes being singled out in two randomly selected news stories that addressed this topic (for further details, see Salgado et al., 2015: 110).3 In sum, a characteristic is an issue included in the content analysis (causes of the crisis, etc.) and catalogued by the relative frequencies that result from coding that issue. Three types of ‘populations’ were defined in this study: first, the 20 single news- papers; second, the two groups of 10 newspapers each, which result from the aggrega- tion of all of the centre-left in one aggregate and all of the centre-right in another, to analyse the weight of ideology in coverage; and third, to assess the national position, 10 aggregates representing the national samples of the 10 countries, that include the two types of newspapers from each country.
Lieberson (1969) developed an extension of Simpson’s D, the multivariate Dw, to measure diversity in the cases where a population is classified by more than just one characteristic. In our approach, not only the causes of the crisis, but also, for example, responsibility, solutions and so on.4 Then, to study diversity across different populations, Lieberson (1969) developed a further extension of Simpson’s D, called Db. An example of its utilization may be calculating the probability of finding different causes of the Euro Crisis in two randomly selected news stories from two different newspapers.5 The gain in diversity obtained by the coverage of two newspapers – instead of only one – can be obtained calculating the absolute or percentage increase of Db over the average Dw of the two newspapers, which provides an indication of the average increase of diversity; or alternatively over the Dw of the newspaper presenting lower diversity, which indicates the increase of diversity to which the audience of this paper would be exposed by reading a second newspaper. We interpret the Dw of any single newspaper as ‘internal plurality’, the Dw of the ideology aggregates as ‘plurality according to ideological positioning’, and the Dw of the 10 national aggregates as ‘country plurality’. The Db between left and right ‘populations’ (newspapers or aggregates) is named ‘cross-ideological plurality’, and finally, the Db between the 10 countries’ aggregates refers to ‘cross-country plurality’.",Related to topics (e.g. sports or politics or economics),,,,,,,"Content Analysis (quantitative, manual or (semi-)annotated )",,No,,,,,,,,Yes - look up the source in the references and copy the doi (or other identifying information if not present) here,,Yes - Copy the formula (including explanation of the variables) or the description of the mathematical procedure here,,No,,The same as for the other dimension (see above),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No second medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,ideology (of the newspaper),time,countries,,,Other,Inspecting the D values for the different types of newspapers (no formal testing),"Other (not mentioned or qualitative study, please fill in how the authors judge the influence)",There is almost no gain in plurality when we compare the levels of cross-ideological plurality (Db) with the average plurality in the two different political orientations (column 6 in Table 2).

(2009) ","Building upon the definition provided by Van Cuilenburg (1999), in our study
we measure the heterogeneity of news content in terms of actor and viewpoint
diversity.

The diversity of actors refers to the range of category affiliations of
actors who are quoted or paraphrased in the news

The second dimension – diversity of viewpoints – has been considered by
different authors as being core to the concept of content diversity. Griswold
(1999) intuitively notices that, although various actors might feature in a discussion
about a certain issue in the news, it is ultimately the diversity of viewpoints
that guarantees the democratic benefit of content diversity, providing
readers with a plurality of perspectives on a given topic. In line with this,
Voakes et al. (1996, p. 585) propose a comprehensive definition of viewpoint
diversity as the range of “ideas, perspectives, attributions, opinions, or frames
within a news product”. In keeping with this definition, Van Gorp (2005) analyzes
the use of frames in Belgian news about the asylum issue, identifying a
dichotomy between an “intruder” and a “victim” frame. In a similar way, Benson
(2009) measures frame diversity in immigration-related news in France and
the US, pinpointing ten frame categories which characterize the mediated debate
on immigration in those countries.",Yes,"One media article (i.e. one newspaper article),One media outlet (i.e. one newspaper, one TV channel, one social media platform),More than one media outlet (in different sectors; this also includes aggregating platforms such as Google News)",,"Supply perspective  (i.e. centered on the ${lm://Field/1} provided by media outlets, platforms or aggregators to the general public)",,"Related to actors or entities (e.g. the diversity of politicians mentioned in the media, diversity of organisations),Related to viewpoints or perspectives (also includes: frames; whether it includes conservative or liberal positions)",actor diversity,viewpoint diversity,,,,,Yes,More than one coder,3,Yes,Krippendorff's alpha,,0.65,No,642,5% (~32),Not reported,,Newspaper (online),,Yes,"Related to actors or entities (e.g. the diversity of politicians mentioned in the media, diversity of organisations)",,,,,,,"Content Analysis (quantitative, manual or (semi-)annotated )",,No,,,,,,,,No,,No,,No,,"Both actor and viewpoint diversity (see Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2) are

in a news article, this would also be the maximum score for actor diversity.

Based on this understanding, many studies consider the diversity of political (elite) actors represented in the news media (Ho and Quinn 2009; Pritchard 2002). They investi- gate the diversity of speakers in the news coverage produced by individual outlets to
determine whether there is a balanced representation of political interests

Another understanding of diversity underlying these two models is operationalized as viewpoint diversity (Ho and Quinn 2009; Pritchard 2002). It is argued that different interpretations of a complex reality can exist simultaneously and that the level of careful reflection on these interpretations is a crucial measure of a debate’s quality.

For each news story we coded whether speakers with opposing viewpoints (expressed in separate quotations) existed. In contrast to the measures for elite actor and geographical diversity that are aggre- gated to the outlet level, viewpoint diversity reflects a more rigid understanding of diversity since different viewpoints have to be included within single news stories.

Some minor differences between countries (Italy have more actor diversity)

The differences between actor and viewpoint diversity are described in much greater detail: 

Our results show that newspapers include on average
less than two different actor categories per article, excluding those that have no actors
(mean = 1.82, SD = 0.24), which gives the idea of a rather low actor diversity. On the contrary,
actor diversity scores calculated with Simpson’s Dz are on average close to 1
(mean = 0.82, SD = 0.07)

Moving the attention to the viewpoints, newspapers present a rather limited
average of 1.36 categories per article, if we exclude those with no viewpoints (SD = 0.11).
Nonetheless, as observed for actor diversity, Dz viewpoint diversity scores are close to 1,
which means that the distribution of the four types of viewpoints is well balanced for
each newspaper over the period (mean = 0.89, SD = 0.08). To sum up, these findings
support the first broad assumption of this paper: measurements of content diversity at
different levels yield different results, and provide a different evaluation of content diversity.
Nevertheless, we also find a significant positive correlation between the scores of
actor diversity at the article level and Dz scores for actor diversity at the outlet level (r =
0.592, N = 22, p = 0.004), and a weaker correlation between the two levels of viewpoint
diversity scores (r = 0.473, N = 22, p = 0.026), which suggest a moderate positive relationship
between measurements of content diversity at the article and at the newspaper level."

The methodology of this paper is similar to that used by George and Gee (2011), who consider the issues covered in news programmes in order to calculate an index of media diversity.

We thus measured the association between actors and channels within each group (that is, we considered 3 × 22 tables). Table 2 shows the results of a chi-square test, along with Cramer’s V, a relative index of association, for news time, speaking time and broadcasting time.

The last two rows of Table 2 show the results of a chi-square test and a Cramer’s V test when we consider the Rai and Mediaset channels in aggregate. Again, the variable of inter- est is the share of airtime devoted to social actors 1–22. The differences in the distribution of airtime across social actors between Rai and Mediaset are significant. 

Table 3 shows the results of an Ordinary Least Square analysis with, as the dependent variable, the normalised standard deviation of the coverage of social actors within the Rai and Mediaset newscasts (internal pluralism). The index is similar to that proposed by George and Gee (2011), who calculated the standard deviation in category word shares across local TV stations, in order to measure issue diversity.

A similar analysis is applied to inter-group differences (external pluralism). Table 4 pre- sents the dissimilarity between the Rai and Mediaset distribution of broadcasting time. The index of dissimilarity is the following

Previous research, by addressing filter bubbles as primarily a technical phe- nomenon, effectively operationalises technical determinism. The object of the current analysis, by contrast, is to demonstrate that the filter bubble is as much a social concern as a technical problem: if not more so.

Ostensibly, it is not a new concept: just reading the same politically affiliated newspaper is the prototypical form of ‘bubbling’ (the practice of creating a filter bubble). In 1995, Negroponte predicted that the World Wide Web would amplify bubbling. He called it the ‘daily me’ effect–that produces a ‘kind of newspaper printed in an edition of one’ (Negroponte, 1996: 153). By 2006, Sunstein was saying the Web had allowed us to cre- ate our own information cocoons (Sunstein, 2006).

I used digital methods to capture search engine data and qualitative methods to place search engine use into the context of other platforms and modes of communication, including talk between peers, teachers and families

Therefore, at each site, I began with an hour-long semi- structured group interview, during which we discussed how they used the web for information and the topics that interested the students.

Based on the topics that engaged the cohort in the group interviews, I gave the groups a series of contested or controversial questions to answer individually and without look- ing at any sources (off or online), before returning their answers to me on paper. Next, I asked the students to research these questions online. Although the questions were informed by the group interview so they could reflect the students’ concerns, I included some identical questions across both sites so I could directly compare search engine usage at each site, and the influence of the technologies of production on the search results. 

For the research exercises, I was given a room of PCs at Chancery and Apple Macs at Calshot. I installed software called Squid (http://www.squid-cache.org/) on my laptop, which is designed for caching web traffic by proxy. Using this, I was able to capture in real time all the HTTP traffic that was sent to each client machine the students used via the institution’s web server and router.

Yet, despite these signals, when the students used Google and the same key words, regardless of location (Calshot or Chancery), the SERPs were remarkably similar.

Variation was measured here by calculating the percentage of ""para- graph mentions"" in a given paper devoted to each topic. The researcher then computed the standard devia- tion (SD), a measure of variation, of these percentages.

Thirty-one broad (macro) topics were identified. [See Table 1] Breaking these down further, 116 specific (micro) topics resulted. For example, the macro topic of AIDS encompassed 11 micro categories: the parliament's program to combat AIDS, program implementation, drug prices, Mbeki's controversial view that AIDS might not be caused by the HIV virus, fundraising, U.S. AIDS policy, the AIDS-related death of Mandela's son, AIDS communication, the stigma attached to the disease, the severity and extent of AIDS infections and religious / moral arguments.^''
The primary unit of analysis was the paragraph mention—each instance in which a micro or macro category was mentioned in a paragraph.
Paragraph mentions, of course, reflect within-story space devoted to topics, while story mentions do not. Focusing on paragraph mentions could be ques- tioned as paragraphs vary in length. However, paragraph length differed relatively little in a given paper. Further, most analyses focused on percentages of paragraphs within a paper. Thus, variation in paragraph length from paper to paper was largely taken out of play.
The percentage of paragraph mentions within a paper devoted to a topic was calculated. The author converted each percentage to a decimal fraction, and a p.(log21/p.) value was calculated for each fraction. Values were summed to yield an H-statistic for each paper.

This typology did not include all possible nuances of information formats. Particularly, the serious–light dimension encompasses multiple shadings (see Brants and Neijens, 1998). By concentrating on the main contrasts between information programmes, these four categories allowed a comparison of public affairs programmes over time, and thus changing relationships between TV programming and viewing behaviour. Each programme was assigned to the category that matched its fea- tures best based on programme descriptions in programme guides.1

Viewers were regarded as exposed to a programme if they watched it for at least five minutes. For every viewer the exact viewing duration in minutes per week was deter- mined per information format. An equal duration of exposure could however result from different viewing styles. To distinguish viewers who watched a small number of pro- grammes without switching away, from those who only watched fragments of many different programmes, the average proportion of programmes watched per programme type was calculated. 

we concluded that the increase of viewing alternatives was accompanied by a diversification of information viewing in the Netherlands. Overall, viewers spent more time watching both serious and light information formats. Fewer viewers focused on serious formats over time.
