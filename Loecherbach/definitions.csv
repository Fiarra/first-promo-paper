Another understanding of diversity underlying these two models is operationalized as viewpoint diversity (Ho and Quinn 2009; Pritchard 2002).

as inclusion of counter-attitudinal information (Pariser, 2011), in computer science it is
considered a necessary design element, often conceptualized as the inclusion of unexpected

science, whereas social scientists analyze diversity primarily at the output level:
Whereas the former study how to optimize the inclusion of surprising or unexpected
items, social scientists focus on the overall output of a recommender system and assess
its diversity (Sørensen & Schmidt, 2016).

First, diversity can aim at a multitude of sources. Such source diversity describes the pluralism
of quoted actors’ affiliations or status positions

Yet, source diversity may also depict the variety of news outlets
which are included in a recipient’s news diet, especially in the context of news aggregators
(Thurman 2011). Second, diversity can refer to the variety of covered topics. This
so-called content diversity oftentimes relates to the mere appearance of topics in their
most basic form, such as “public affairs” or “baseball.” Yet, it may also include the multitude
of perspectives, which ideally represent a democracy’s political spectrum of opinions
(Entman and Wildman 1992).

Third, diversity can relate to a variation of
viewpoints (i.e., framing). This viewpoint diversity subsumes available frames on a given
topic and is thus clearly the most demanding type of diversity, both for journalists to produce
and for researchers to measure (Baden and Springer 2015)","Baden and Springer 2015Voakes et al. 1996; Thurman 2011; Entman and Wildman 1992; ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"13","000610@2018.nl","div","As one of the central communication policy goals, diversity refers to the idea that in a democratic society informed citizens collect information about the world from a diverse mix of sources with different viewpoints so that they can make balanced and well-con- sidered decisions.

As we discuss below, there is no commonly accepted definition of exposure diversity or the possible policy objectives behind it, even in aca- demic literature.

Any initiative to promote more diverse exposure to information will first have to deal with the question of what ‘diverse exposure’ actually is. In debates on media diversity, exposure diversity is used to refer to the content that the audience actually selects, as opposed to all the content that is available (McQuail, 1992)

discussions around media diversity have tended to focus primarily on the supply side (the aspects of source and content diversity) and questions of what would characterize a diverse market structure or diverse content offers (Helberger, 2012; Napoli, 1999; Valcke, 2011)

Despite decades of debate on diver- sity as a policy objective, however, there is no consensus on a generally accepted, consist- ent definition of what constitutes ‘diversity’ or ‘pluralism’, even at the level of supply (Karppinen, 2013; Napoli, 1999; Neuberger & Lobgis, 2010; Valcke, 2004)

Firstly, exposure diversity can be defended from the perspective of the traditional liberal ideals of individual autonomy and consumer choice. The possible benchmarks and criteria used to identify the desirable level and form of exposure diversity would thus include aspects such as user satisfaction and awareness of options and choices.

Secondly, exposure to diverse information is commonly justified from the perspective of inclusive public debate. Possible benchmarks and criteria to assess exposure diversity from the deliberative perspective include the reciprocity and inclusive- ness of public discourse – meaning that debates should be open to all and participants should be willing to exchange ideas and viewpoints, and even change their opinion when faced with new arguments or evidence

Thirdly, exposure diversity can also be justified from the perspective of more radical agon- istic or adversarial conceptions of democracy. Exposure diversity can be seen as a corrective to the tendency of public debates to be dominated by existing elites and powerful interests. This is achieved particularly by con- testing the boundaries of mainstream public debate and promoting exposure to critical voices and disadvantaged views that otherwise might be silenced in the public debate (see e.g., Young, 2000)

the modern challenges to the realization of media diversity as a policy goal lie less and less in guaranteeing a diversity of supply, and more in the quest to create the conditions under which users can actually find and choose between diverse content (Burri, 2016; Helberger, 2012; Korthals, 2013, p. 35).

However, these recent discussions again lack a clear normative conception of exposure diversity. Accordingly, acknowledging the need for such a normative discussion to inform not only law and policy-makers but also designers could be the first step. As Bernhard Rie- der (2009, p. 134) remarks, ‘without a clear normative standpoint it is difficult to formulate suggestions about how search ought to work","(McQuail, 1992); Helberger, 2012; Napoli, 1999; Valcke, 2011;Karppinen, 2013; Napoli, 1999; Neuberger & Lobgis, 2010; Valcke, 2004;Young, 2000;Burri, 2016; Helberger, 2012; Korthals, 2013; Rieder (2009)","","different viewpoints","","diverse mix of sources ",""

The second dimension – diversity of viewpoints – has been considered by
different authors as being core to the concept of content diversity. Griswold
(1999) intuitively notices that, although various actors might feature in a discussion
about a certain issue in the news, it is ultimately the diversity of viewpoints
that guarantees the democratic benefit of content diversity, providing
readers with a plurality of perspectives on a given topic. In line with this,
Voakes et al. (1996, p. 585) propose a comprehensive definition of viewpoint
diversity as the range of “ideas, perspectives, attributions, opinions, or frames
within a news product”. In keeping with this definition, Van Gorp (2005) analyzes
the use of frames in Belgian news about the asylum issue, identifying a
dichotomy between an “intruder” and a “victim” frame. In a similar way, Benson

the US, pinpointing ten frame categories which characterize the mediated debate
on immigration in those countries.","Van Cuilenburg (1999); Griswold (1999); Voakes et al. (1996, p. 585) ; Van Gorp (2005); Benson

foster the existence of an informed citizenry, an environment of inclusiveness

Translating this so-called “diversity principle” into media system
assessment has often taken the form of efforts to assess the range of sources
and viewpoints represented in traditional mass media outlets (Napoli, 1999).

The diversity of content on the Internet does not translate to
the diversity of reception. As Napoli (2011, p. 246) notes, “with all of the
information outlets currently available, focusing on source and content
diversity is becoming less important than understanding the information that
is actually consumed by media users.” One of the key challenges, then, is to

"24","001505@2017.nl","div","At the same time, the focal matter of contention
– the diversity of viewpoints – notoriously eludes definition and measurement (Benson,
2009). Specifically, it remains unclear which observed variations in the news meaningfully
contribute to viewpoint diversity (Napoli, 1999)

Focusing on the diversity of news content (Napoli, 1999), we review available
research and theorizing to discuss the concept’s normative relevance and operational
specification.

While most conceptualizations of democratic debates depend on some notion of viewpoint
diversity, they emphasize different aspects, and differ in how much diversity is
deemed adequate

In our view, speaker-oriented approaches to viewpoint diversity offer little help for
deciding whose viewpoints should be represented: they either externalize the problem
by privileging positional elites, or implicitly refer to content-based criteria by inviting
speakers expected to contribute different interpretations. By contrast, content-oriented
views approximate the representation of all relevant aspects of a concern: they provide
both measures and criteria for discriminating valuable from redundant contributions

Most available measures of viewpoint diversity
access the diversity of interpretations only indirectly (Voakes et al., 1996)

Other studies assess viewpoint diversity using content analytic methodology (Hayes and Guardino, 2010; Humprecht and Büchel, 2013;
Muschert, 2009). However, it is not always transparent how their indicators were chosen
and can validly and relatively exhaustively capture the available interpretations (Voakes
et al., 1996).

However, diverse sources may
echo the same few interpretations; likewise, few actors can present a wider or narrower
diversity of viewpoints (Ferree et al., 2002; Holcomb et al., 2011; Voakes et al., 1996

Among those approaches focusing on the diversity of news content, three related strategies
emphasize the tone or political position represented in the news: in the simplest
case, viewpoint diversity is considered high if official viewpoints are contrasted against
some counterframes (Bennett, 1990; Hanitzsch and Mellado, 2011; Hayes and Guardino,
2010)

A slightly more differentiated variant assesses the diversity of tones
attached to political issues (Hayes and Guardino, 2010).

A third approach codes political slant (Ho and Quinn, 2008; Pritchard, 2002). At
least in multiparty systems, this approach can distinguish also beyond two interpretations,
albeit in rather coarse grain.

In this article, we consider all frames as diverse that contribute to different interpretative
repertoires

A first approach is to simply determine
the number of distinct patterns in which the respective logics are used for specific framing
functions (number of viewpoints) – for example, by applying some clustering/topic
modeling or, dimension reduction technique (Baden and Springer, 2014; Matthes and
Kohring, 2008).

Therefore, second,
we can assess the uniqueness of ‘entries’ for the different ‘slots’ in constructed
frames (viewpoint variability): a repertoire wherein each ‘slot’ is uniquely assigned has
lower viewpoint diversity than one allowing variable entries to be combined without
breaking coherence.

Third, we can derive
another criterion of viewpoint diversity from the assumptions required to render detected
repertoires coherent (viewpoint distinctness): assumptions made by different repertoires
can overlap (e.g. sharing moral evaluation standards)

A debate wherein all advanced repertoires
are at least passively compatible is, accordingly, less diverse than one that includes
viewpoints that cannot simultaneously be accepted. If we apply such measures alongside
the more conventional coding of actors represented in the coverage, not only can we
assess whether and when additional speakers increase the diversity of viewpoints represented","Voakes et al., 1996 (Napoli, 1999); Benson, 2009;Hayes and Guardino, 2010; Humprecht and Büchel, 2013; Muschert, 2009; Ferree et al., 2002; Holcomb et al., 2011; Hayes and Guardino, 2010; Bennett, 1990; Hanitzsch and Mellado, 2011; Hayes and Guardino, 2010; Baden and Springer, 2014; Matthes and

Connections drawn between these two sub-components of news diversity have been built on the assumption that source diversity will lead to content diversity in a truly competitive marketplace (Napoli 1999; Van Cuilenberg 2000). While this assumption has often proven problematic—structural diversity does not automatically ensure diversity of content—researchers have examined various sub-components of content diversity, including format or program-type, demographic and idea-viewpoints (Napoli 1999, 18–24). Measuring the diversity of idea-viewpoints within media content is often considered a form of reflective diversity, that is, a way to assess the “actual match between users’ preferences and the reflection of these preferences in media content” (Van Cuilenberg 2000, 53).

Youth’s widespread adoption of sharing and creation techniques has several implications for notions of diversity. At the conceptual level, increased interactivity suggests that traditional categories such as producers, distributors, and recipients are blurring when applied to youth and news online. Viewed from this phenomenological angle, diversity models will have to take into account the interactive relationship between what has previously been labeled the audience, as part of exposure diversity, and nontraditional co-creators of news, as part of source diversity. As youth are no longer only consumers but also co-creators and sharers of news, traditional notions of source and content diversity now might take into account demographic or ethnic diversity outside the familiar dimensions of organizational and economic structures of professional media companies.

On the one hand, ‘diversity’ has to be located on the ontic dimension of the social, as it regards mere physical or empirical differences, such as the range of identities and concerns (differences within society)

‘affirmative diversity’ is represented by the metaphors of media as ‘mirrors of society’ and ‘marketplaces of ideas’ and draws on the liberal-aggre- gative school of democratic theory. Conceptually, it relates to ‘diversity’ as it expects media to truthfully reflect the existing social heterogeneity.

Research starting from the affirmative diversity-approach is concerned about a bal- anced media representation of social diversity, for instance, in terms of actors, issues, and viewpoints.

interpreted as ‘criti- cal diversity’ is illustrated by the metaphor of media as ‘cultural industries’

However, instead of focusing solely on media content, their concern lays mainly with the commercial interests and mechanisms of media organizations and the routines of media practitioners, and how these determine the level of diversity within media coverage. Clearly, the research field is divided because of the unlimited range of structural charac- teristics. For example, regarding ownership, research can focus on ownership concentra- tion (e.g. Hanretty, 2014), the agenda of owners (e.g. Anand et al., 2007), ownership structures (e.g. Yanich, 2010), or ownership limits (e.g. Horwitz, 2005).","","","","","",""
"37","002524@2015.nl","div","According to McQuail (2007), diversity is “the most potent concept in communication policy in modern times” (p. 41).

Diversity, in turn, more frequently describes the variety of content available to or consumed by citizen

From the first perspective, diversity is generated by a plurality of available media or content, and the latter conceptualizes media diversity as a result of user behavior. In this vein, McQuail (1992, p. 157) differentiates “content as sent” from “content as received.”

The notion of exposure diversity assumes that pluralism is achieved when users actually enjoy a diverse media diet (Hagel & Brown, 2009; van Cuilenburg, 1998)

Based on SCT, we argue that both supply diversity and exposure diversity are necessary but not sufficient conditions of media pluralism in the digital age.

Yet, mere exposure is not synonymous with actual attention to and perception and experience of diversity (Goodman, 2004).

We define diversity experience as the cognitive processing of diverse information.

Thus, diversity exposure—the encountering of diverse content—results in diversity experience only if users perceive and digest this content according to their motivations, awareness, and capabilities.

The social cognitive perspective on media diversity is particularly helpful in the analysis of media diversity in the digital age because it stresses the importance of personal influences as a complement to environmental/institutional (supply) and behavioral (exposure) aspects

These challenges can be understood as three barriers that users must overcome to experience media diversity in an online environment:
1. Users may not be motivated to seek out diversity.
2. Users may not be aware of current limits to diversity.
3. Users may not be able to ensure access to diversity.

Based on SCT, we propose that the pluralism debate must employ a user-centric perspective and thereby extend beyond the assumption that supply diversity equals diversity exposure

SCT shows that environmental factors (such as diversity supply) and behavioral factors (such as diversity exposure) interact in creating personal cognitions and affect (such as diversity experience)","McQuail (2007); (Hagel & Brown, 2009; van Cuilenburg, 1998);McQuail (1992, p. 157)","","","","","diversity experience"

The public-service media play a critical role in that context. An aspect that has been less prominent in traditional diversity policies is the actual choices users make as another, different dimension of media diversity—known as “diversity of exposure” (Napoli, 1999) or “content as received” (McQuail, 1992).

Exposure diversity examines the audience dimension of media diversity and asks to what extent the diversity of content and supply actually results in a (more) diverse program consumption.

 Evidence from empirical studies demonstrates that, although it is a necessary precondition, “on its own diversity of supply cannot secure diversity of reception” (McQuail, 1992, p. 158) or “diversity of choice” (Van der Wurff, 2004) for the audience.

Although far from being a comprehensive definition of exposure diversity, the Ofcom definition gives at least some guidance on what exposure diversity from a user perspective could mean: to be “able to access and consume a wide range of viewpoints across a variety of platforms and media owners” (Ofcom, 2012, p. 8). In other words, diversity should make people smarter and better informed

"39","002533@2015.nl","div","In media policy, the idea of pluralism is often used interchangeably with notions such as “diversity,” “plurality of information” and “multiplicity of voices.” The general concept both describes and makes normative claims about various commercial models and forms of content that can or should be found in the media

In practice, regulatory schemes feature combinations of at least three components—diversity of content, of source, and of distribution platform—but it is diversity of content that lies at the core of media pluralism.

Diversity of source relates to the origin of the content.

Diversity of distribution refers to the various delivery services that select and present material directly to the audience.

It is evident that the underlying theme in policy discussion of media pluralism, across all its dimensions of diversity, is that information should simply be accessible. All that is required is that members of a democratic society should be exposed to the range of different viewpoints that exist and should have their viewpoints adequately represented (Council of Europe, 2003; Craufurd Smith, 1997; Hitchens, 2007; Valcke et al., 2010). As the Council of Europe (1999) has stated, “It should be stressed that pluralism is about diversity in the media that is made available to the public, which does not always coincide with what is actually consumed” (para. 3

Another strand of thinking, which moves the discussion a little closer to a more active conception of media pluralism, is the literature on exposure diversity (Helberger, 2012; Napoli, 2011)

Exposure diversity is therefore concerned with the audience and user dimensions of media pluralism and the extent to which diversity of supply actually leads to diverse consumption.

First, a concern with active pluralism is one that will be mainly focused on diversity of content. Structural measures for diversity of sources and outlets would continue to be important in making content available, but the aim would be to encourage dialogue that would require mechanisms for bringing different sets of standpoints together in some way","Council of Europe, 2003; Craufurd Smith, 1997; Hitchens, 2007; Valcke et al., 2010; Helberger, 2012; Napoli, 2011","","diversity of viewpoints","","diversity of distribution","diversity of source (origin of the content)"
"40","002547@2015.nl","div","Here, diversity is a principle of the dispersal of economic and political power, and the precondition for the reception of various opinions on the side of the audience.

The so-called “diversity principle“ builds on the premise, popular also among policy- makers, that diverse ownership brings diverse content and that diverse content automati- cally brings about a lively, democratic and open public sphere. 

If we look at the principle from the general perspective, the European research tradition mainly refers to “pluralism“ that stems from media diversity, resulting in “the presence of a number of different and independent voices, and of differing political opinions and representations of culture within the media“ (Doyle 2002, 11), whereas the Anglo-American researchers prefer the term “diver- sity“ and the “marketplace of ideas”

However, the “marketplace of ideas” still does not specify various dimensions of diversity. In order to embrace the variations in space, sources and ideas, I will use Phillip M. Napoli’s conceptualisation of the deconstructed diver- sity, which consists of the “exposure diversity”, “source diversity“ (marking ownership and workforce diversity) and “content diversity”, that in turn consists also of the program- type format, demographic and idea/viewpoint diversity (Napoli 1999, 10).

 These two explain the het- erogeneity of the content according to the criteria of whether or not the media reflect and report on a given relative distribution of opinions in society, or media enable all various opinions and positions to get the same amount of attention (Cuilenburg 1999, 189–190). 

However, it potentially opens the (transna- tional) public sphere and heightens the conditions for “exposure diversity”. It designates “diversity of content as received”, which according to McQuail is an audience-oriented measure of plurality, “what the audience actually selects“ (1992, 157).

Innovations and competition are fruitful for product diversification as long as only a handful of companies innovate and compete, which leads to the contradiction whereby more media outlets mean less diversity. 

This also means that it is not the market structure per se which affects the diversity, but the central drive to valorise capital through the production of media content as exchange values","Doyle 2002; Napoli 1999; Cuilenburg 1999; McQuail (1992)","","","","diverse ownership","content diversity"

In contrast to source and content diversity, however, exposure diversity has never been explicitly defined as a media policy objective in the United States (Napoli, 2011), Europe (Valcke, 2011), or internationally (Burri, 2010).

 In terms of goal definition, it should be clear that we do not single out exposure diversity to the detriment of either source or content diversity, as there is broad agreement that these two endure as key media policy objectives, although, perhaps, with somewhat diminished demand for action because of conditions of the digital environment (Napoli, 2011, 2012; Valcke, 2011).","Napoli, 2011; Valcke, 2011; Burri, 2010; Napoli, 2011, 2012; Valcke, 2011","","","","","Content diversity"

studies. The freedom of media, a multiplicity of opinions and
the good of society are inextricably connected (Napoli, 1999). Free
Press theory, a theory of media diversity, states that we establish
and preserve conditions that provide many alternative voices,
regardless of intrinsic merit or truth, with the condition that they
emerge from those whom society is supposed to benefit its individual
members and constituent groups (van Cuilenburg & McQuail,
2003). What is good for the members of the society can only be discovered
by the free expression of alternative goals and solutions to
problems, often disseminated through media (Napoli, 1999).
While many scholars from different disciplines agree that information
diversity is an important value that we should include in
the design of institutions, policies and online services, this value
is often reduced to a single definition, such as ‘‘source diversity’’,
or ‘‘hearing the opinion of the other side’’.

Following Napoli (1999), we may distinguish three different
dimensions of information diversity. The first dimension is source
diversity, which is diversity in terms of outlets (cables and channel
owners) or program producers (content owners). Content diversity
consists of diversity in format (program-type), demographic (in
terms of racial, ethnic, and gender), and idea-viewpoint (of social,
political and cultural perspectives). The third dimension, exposure
diversity, deals with audience reach and whether users have actually
consumed a diverse set of items.

Karppinen (2009) argues that the aim of media diversity should
not be the multiplication of genre, sources or markets, but giving
voice to different members of the society.

McQuail and van Cuilenburg (1983) propose to assess media
diversity by introducing two normative frameworks. The norm of
reflection checks whether ‘‘media content proportionally reflects
differences in politics, religion, culture and social conditions in a
more or less proportional way. The norm of openness checks
whether media ‘‘provide perfectly equal access to their channels
for all people and all ideas in society. If the population preferences
were uniformly distributed over society, then satisfying the first
condition (reflection) would also satisfy the second condition
(equal access).","van Cuilenburg & McQuail,2003; Napoli, 1999; Karppinen (2009); McQuail and van Cuilenburg (1983) ","minority diversity",NA,NA,"source diversity","output diversity (diversity of what is shared)"

a consistent tug of war between two contrasting ideological camps – market
approach versus cultural approach. The market model believes that free-market
competition among a plethora of news media more efficiently serves media
diversity, while the cultural model argues that governmental intervention is
unavoidable to achieve the goal of media diversity (Entman and Wildman
1992).

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in its Biennial
Regulatory Review (2003) identifies five categories of media diversity that are
related to media ownership policy: diversity of viewpoint, programme, outlet,
source and minority/female ownership. Viewpoint diversity relates to the availability
of a diverse range of media content that reflects a variety of perspectives
from social groups. The availability of an extensive range of views is essential to
a healthy democracy and vibrant public debates. Rules limiting concentration of
media ownership are generally deemed to be in the public interest because they
prevent a few individual owners from exercising excessive impact on public opinion
(McCann 2010)

Program diversity refers to the availability of a variety of programming
formats and contents. In an open media market with free entry, free competition
can promote program diversity

Outlet diversity is linked to the presence of multiple and independently
owned broadcasters.

Napoli’s (1999) typology suggests something different about media diversity
than the FCC. According to him, media diversity is composed of three
components: source diversity, content diversity and exposure diversity

Hoffmann-Riem (1987) articulated four dimensions of media diversity:
formats/issues, content, person/group and geographical diversity.

Drawing on the literature,
this study pays attention to two common dimensions of media diversity:
outlet diversity and content diversity. Channel diversity can be enfolded

Is diversity achieved when as many cultural, social, religious or political viewpoints as possible appear in the mass media? Is diversity a matter of content quality or quantity? 

 There may very well be a difference between di- versity of scale – as measured by the sheer quantity of media outlets, and diversity of scope – which must be inferred from patterns of qual- ity in content.166 These high-level questions of “what is diversity?” in the modern media landscape must be answered before jumping straight into regulatory strategies for achieving it

There is an important difference between viewing diversity as an in- stitutional value, which can be virtuous, and viewing it as an achievable policy goal, which can be perilous.","","","","","",""

First, as measures of system diversity are primarily based on relative distributions of categories, they fail to account for absolute increases or decreases. Second, because diversity measures are often composite measures based on relative distributions, they fail to show which specific constituent category (i. e., program type) is responsible for the change in diversity. Moreover, even changes in the relative distribution across program types over time may not be revealed in changes in the level of diversity2.

Yet, diversity that is only sent but not received cannot have the positive effects attributed to a diverse media supply. More research on the conditions that foster or inhibit the reception of diversity is therefore necessary (Napoli, 1997).

Taking up this call, this article presents a first exploratory take on the important but hitherto neglected concept of diversity as received.

Diversity is ‘one of the foundation principles in communications policy’ (Napoli, 1999: 7). It is defined as the heterogeneity of media content on one or more dimensions (McQuail and Van Cuilenburg, 1983).

Frequently investigated dimensions include TV programme type and news topic. From a democratic perspective, the variety of political ideas expressed in media is of special interest. Such idea diversity (Napoli, 1999) is an impor- tant condition for well-informed decision-making and an expression of a healthy democ- racy (McQuail, 1992).

Specifically, this research created a measure of content diversity to make these comparisons. Measures used to define content diversity were (1) the diversity of topics, (2) the use of outbound hyperlinks and (3) the inclusion of multimedia and interactive elements.

Diversity is typically measured by analyzing the diversity of sources present within articles, diversity of staff present within newsrooms or diversity of media information sources or ownership located within a geographic region. This research contributes to diversity literature by examining the diversity of content. Voakes et al. (1996: 585) defined content diversity as ‘a dispersion of the representation of ideas, perspectives, attributions, opinions or frames within a news product, and within the context of one particular issue.’ Content diversity is distinct from source diversity because the inclusion of a diversity of sources does not always equate to a diversity of ideas in articles.

Authors from the Project for Excellence in Journalism (1999) argued that the more topics covered by the news organization, the better the news organization. They claimed a diversity of topics better reflects a community in its entirety.

McQuail (1992) proposes a sequential model of the process of communi- cation which implies that diversity can be analyzed in terms of media structure, media content, and media audience. The present study focuses on media content. Content diversity refers to “the variety or breadth of media content available to media consumers, with higher consumer wel- fare provided by high diversity” (Roessler, 2007, p. 467)

The question as to the optimum level of diversity is a normative one. The most widely used 􏰈 but also disputed 􏰈 measures in diversity re- search are based on equal representation of all categories under study as the ideal level of diversity; this is called open diversity (Roessler, 2007).

An alternative to open diversity is reflective diversity, which consists of media expressing ‘different ideas or topics in the same proportion as media users prefer them’ (Van der Wurff and Van Cuilenburg, 2001, p. 214).

Yet, this study focuses on open diversity, since open diversity is especially important in countries with an open multiparty system such as the Netherlands.

Content diversity in terms of the breadth of news coverage can be mea- sured at different levels: at the level of the media system as a whole (horizontal diversity) and at the level of individual media outlets (vertical diversity) (Hellman, 2001)

As framing involves the construction of views in both news production and consumption processes, the concept appears to be a proper analytical tool to examine the relationship between media content diversity and audience issue cognitions.

Research on frame diversity is limited, but a few studies have examined agenda diversity.

Although pluralism and diversity are used interchangeably in this chapter it is worth going through some definitions of the concepts to establish why the lack of these ideals in a highly concentrated media market might be an issue of public concern. A broad definition of media diversity has been provided by Hoffmann-Riem (1987) who referring to the broadcasting scene a couple of decades ago distinguished four dimensions of diversity. For him there must be diversity of formats and issues, meaning that all the various fields and topics - entertainment, information, education and culture - have to be taken into account. Secondly, this should be complemented by a diversity or plurality of contents. This means that programmes should provide comprehensive and factual coverage of the different opinions expressed in a society. Thirdly, person and group diversity must exist. Programmes have to cater for the interests of all parts of the community. The main point here is access, but also representation. Finally, Hoffmann-Riem pointed out that broadcasters should include local, regional, national and supranational content. To sum up, a programme has to ensure that issue, content, person and geographical diversity is provided.

A similar identification of the dimensions of diversity has been provided by McQuail (1992: 144-5) who argued that the media can contribute to diversity, firstly by reflecting differences in society, secondly by giving access to different points of view, and thirdly by offering a wide range of choice.

one also needs to distinguish between external and internal diversity. The former, according to McQuail (1992: 145-7) refers to media structure because it is related to the idea of access.

The Diversity Index (US) and the integrated communications market (Italy)
A new approach to assessing viewpoint concentration in local media markets was adopted by the FCC during its third biennial ownership review. This Diversity Index (DI) was introduced to provide ‘its media ownership frame- work with an empirical footing’ (FCC, 2003: 46316). The Commission was responding to claims increasingly voiced both by the courts (e.g. Fox v. FCC, 2002: 1048) and scholars (e.g. Napoli, 1999) that media ownership regula- tions targeted at non-economic goals such as media diversity need to be jus- tified by empirical proof, and that traditional justifications no longer suffice.

There is, however, neither a consensus on what constitutes plurality (e.g.is it a plurality of owners, a plurality of channels and titles and variations within them, or a diversity in content/ideas), nor on how this goal can adequately be achieved, let alone empirically measured.

The German Commission on Concentration in the Media (KEK), the regulatory body responsible for ensuring a diversity of opinion in national broadcasting, entered new ground in the course of its review of the proposed merger between ProSiebenSAT.1 Media AG and Axel Springer Media AG by developing a new weighting approach that takes account of possible influences of various media on the diversity of opinion (KEK, 2006)","Napoli, 1999; FCC, 2003","","","","",""

Among them, the question concerning their contribution to diversity is of predominant importance at the macro level of research. ‘Diversity has been the most potent concept in communication policy in modern times and in some degree remains so’ (McQuail, 2007: 41). Among the many normative concepts in mass communication research, diversity is probably the most prominent one. When Denis McQuail revisited this concept in 2007 he underlined the ambiguities of the concept as well as its continued importance. Diversity can be an end in itself but it can also be a necessary requirement to attain what society requires. 

When new media emerge, the level of diversity is expected to increase. At the levels of ownership, content, receiver/audience and channel, additional mass media might increase diversity.

All these public service features relate closely to the value of diversity. On the content level, quality and diversity are the key features together with requirements to respect minorities and foster national culture and identity (Syvertsen, 2003: 157), as well as the provision of news to enable citizens to participate in the democratic process in an informed way (Steemers, 2001: 126)","McQuail, 2007; Syvertsen, 2003; Steemers, 2001",NA,NA,NA,"ownership diversity","content diversity (kind of article, multimedia included)"

According to Napoli, the concept of media diversity has three major components: (1) source diversity, (2) content diversity, and (3) exposure diversity (see Table 1). Source diversity is defined in terms of media ownership as well as by the diversity of its workforce. Content diversity refers to the multiplicity of viewpoints, program types and the demographic profiles of those represented in media content. Exposure diversity measures how audiences make use of the available options. While each of these three prime components is an indispensable ‘link in the diversity chain’ (Napoli, 1997, p. 18), exposure diversity is considered the most important element in the pursuit of a marketplace of ideas.

In his media diversity model, Napoli (1999) further categorized diversity of exposure into two types: horizontal diversity and vertical diversity. ","Einstein, 2004; McQuail, 1992; Napoli, 1997",NA,NA,NA,"channel repertoires/diversity",NA

2. Plural-closed: when more than one interpretive frame of the political event or issue is presented by the news story, but the frames are arranged in a hierarchy so that one is preferred over the other(s) and presented as more valid/true
3. Plural-open: when more than one interpretive frame of the political event or issue is presented by the news story, but treated within a more indeterminate relation where no interpretation is preferred

In terms of calculating the Index, within each medium we combine commonly- owned outlets and calculate each owner’s share of the total availability of that me- dium.

Thematic agenda diversity concerns the semantic variety of issues on the agenda of a particular social unit.2 Even if different social units have the same nominal diversity (i.e. name the same number of issues), their thematic diversity may differ.

"80","005880@1999.nl","div","Diversity of information, or media diversity, as the concept is often referred
to in most democratic countries, is considered to be of crucial value and a
central objective of communications and media policy. Media diversity refers
to media content; media diversity is heterogeneity of media content in
terms of one or more speciﬁed characteristics. Variety in news media supply,
for instance, may be measured in terms of distribution of attention across
news categories, political stances, news genres, cultural foci, and so on. This
deﬁnition of diversity is a ‘product deﬁnition’ and as such is not without
policy implication, because it focuses on media content rather than on media market structure and media organizational conduct. Thus, this
deﬁnition avoids a too easy equalization of the number of media outlets to
media performance, e.g. we do not suppose there is a simple positive
connection between competition and diversity. It remains to be seen
whether more media competition really brings about more media variety. 

Two faces of diversity: reflection and openness

Often, media practitioners and politicians think that more media diversity is
‘better’. This. however, is not the case: media diversity always has to be
externally gauged in some way or manner. Gauging, or benchmarking,
should be based on the existing social diversity that media are reporting on.

Put differently, media diversity should always be compared with relevant
variations in society and social reality. Two different normative frameworks
present themselves (McQuail and Van Cuilenburg, 1983).4 Do the media
relate to society in such a way as to reﬂect, pro rata, the distribution of
preference, opinion, allegiance or other characteristic as it appears in the
population? Or is the content distribution within the media such that
perfectly equal attention is given to all identiﬁable preferences, streams, or
groups, or positions in society? If the ﬁrst scenario is the case, the media
adhere to reﬂection as the norm for media diversity: media content
proportionally reﬂects differences in politics, religion, culture and social
conditions in society in a more or less proportional way. If the second
scenario holds, then media performance satisﬁes the norm of openness, that
is, media uniformly, in arithmetically absolute terms, provide perfectly equal
access to their channels for all people and all ideas in society.

Reﬂection in media diversity is depicted in Figure 2 with a purely
hypothetical example. The population curve in Figure 2 represents the
distribution of preferences in the population, e.g. political opinions, religious
beliefs or interests in particular kinds of news, or any other relevant
population characteristic. We assume that population preferences will
correspond with a certain kind of demand for media content. The other
curve, the media curve, represents the media supply, complementing
population preferences and characteristics. Ideally, in the case of maximum
proportional media reflection of population preferences and characteristics,
both curves fully coincide. The example in Figure 2 shows, however, that media preferences only partly overlap with population preferences, indicating
a media deﬁciency in reﬂection.


Figure 3 portrays media supply compared to media supply under the
condition of full openness, i.e. equal access for all preferences in the
population, be they majority or minority preferences or characteristics.
Graphically, equal access, or full openness, may be represented by a uniform
distribution, as in Figure 3: the straight horizontal line indicates that no
category of preference or characteristic in the population gets more media
coverage, attention, and supply than any other preference or characteristic
category. Consequently, open media diversity is, at the same time,
mathematically the maximum diversity media systems can realize.

There is a dialectic relationship between reﬂective (proportional) and open
(uniform) diversity. As both ﬁgures taken together make clear, only if
population characteristics, preferences and conditions are fully horizontal,
that is, uniformly distributed over society, does reﬂection coincide with
openness. This, however, is seldom the case. More often than not,
population characteristics and preferences tend toward the middle; toward
normal distributions, toward mainstreams, so to speak. Media ratings and
research from commercial media research generally show large homogeneity
of actual media preferences and media use in the population. This fact
implies that media reﬂecting society inevitably ill perform regarding
openness to a great variety of different social positions and conditions,
whereas perfectly equal media access harms majority positions in favor of
minority beliefs, attitudes and conditions. There is no easy way out from
this dilemma: proportional reﬂection and uniform openness can hardly ever
both be fully realized at the same time.

So, in studying diversity and new media one should raise the question
whether, and to what extent, the Internet and other new carriers and
communication outlets do indeed increase and enhance social, political and
cultural expression (reﬂective diversity) and discussion and debate (open
diversity) in society.

Many theorists suggest that diversity best ﬂourishes in a free marketplace 9‘
ideas: if people can freely enter this marketplace to exchange information
and opinions, without any constraint by government or any other party,
then we may expect cultural variety and diversity to happen.

Diversity will only result from a marketplace of ideas if the number of
different providers of information is large and competition between them is
full and fair, so that power dominance does not exist. We also have to
assume that ‘buyers’ of information are fully and rationally informed about
the marketplace. That is, the market is transparent, so that citizens may get a
clear concept of what information in media markets is available to them. 

The diversity paradox stems from the dialectics between reﬂective and
open diversity (see Section 3). With informatization of society and the
increase in media outlets, media diversity has indeed reached an unimaginable
level: it is very difﬁcult to specify types of contents which are nowhere
available in media markets. However, media markets are far better at
producing proportional reﬂection of majority civic interests and consumer
preferences (Figure 2), than in equal, uniform openness to political and
cultural innovations, stemming from minorities and new groups in society
(Figure 3).

Competition may indeed favor media quality,
but it is reﬂective diversity that gains most by competition.

Some hypotheses on competition and diversity
The relationships between different forms of media competition and media
diversity may be expressed in the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1 Media competition and content hypothesis (derived from
Hotelling).

The more media compete for marketshare, the more they compete on price
(Cr) (ﬁerce competition), the less they compete on content (Ci) (moderate
competition).

The more media diversity is reﬂective diversity (DI), the less media diversity is
open, equal access diversity (DU)

The more media compete for marketshare, the more they compete on price
(C1,), the less they compete on content (C), the more media diversity is
reﬂective diversity (Dr), and the less media diversity is open diversity (Do).

So, if democracy presupposes diversity, and diversity itself is being promoted
by competition, we really should adhere to a free marketplace of ideas. We
have seen, however, that the connection between these variables is far from
simple. ","McQuail and Van Cuilenburg, 1983","","","","","Open and reflective diversity"

In many southern countries, of course, large sections of the media audience may experience very limited access to some, if not all, media platforms. Significantly, then, an inversion of the view from which to assess media diversity is required in developing countries. 

 It is one matter to measure the diversity of content within a particular print media publication, but the importance of that analysis must be jointly determined by the accessibility (in addition to the availability) of the publication to a specific audience.

Therefore, on assessing media diversity of content in southern countries such as South Africa, the audience must necessarily first be segmented into the varying media bundle categories (once these have been identified), and a media type should preferably be included within an audience segment’s media bundle only if its access and accessibility are rated highly for that particular audience segment. Only then can a content analysis of the level of diversity within the media be initiated, but a separate content analysis should be done for each media bundle category.

Van Cuilenburg (2007, 38–39) makes a case for assessing the diversity of a media market in its entirety, as opposed to analysing the diversity of separate media markets in isolation from one another.

Therefore, if the primary motivator for measuring media diversity is a concern for the diversity of content and available ideas according to which audiences form opinions, it may be better to view the media as a whole, rather than as separate parts. 

 Indeed, the ideals for media diversity held by policy-makers may not necessarily reflect any symmetry with the preferences of the audience(s). Therefore, as part of the project of establishing a media diversity measurement tool, an audience study becomes essential.


‘Pluralism’ and ‘diversity’ are often used interchangeably, especially in European policy debates. In this article, the terms are understood to be distinctly different. Pluralism refers to the number of media outlets, while diversity refers to the type of voices available in these media outlets, and whether the voices of particularly vulnerable social groups (e.g., women, children, the elderly) are represented in media content. While the extent of the former can be assessed through quantitative indicators, it is difficult to assess the latter without a more qualitative approach.

Three types of diversity 􏰁 source diversity, content diversity, and exposure diversity 􏰁 are considered vitally important to protect the rights of citizens and the functioning of democratic systems of governance (McQuail, 2005; Napoli, 2003).

Without ensuring diversity of views in media content and programming, it is impossible to guarantee ‘an increase in the diversity of content consumed by audiences’ (Napoli, 2003, p. 129).

Source diversity has attracted the attention of policymakers who have attempted various strategies to practically implement the elusive principles enshrined in the concept. Napoli (2003) argued that regulators have operationalized source diversity by warranting diversity of media ownership, by encouraging media outlets to ensure diversity of ownership of content and programming, and by introducing rules paving the way for the recruitment of a diverse workforce","McQuail, 2005; Napoli, 2003","","","","source diversity","content diversity"

As Junge (1994) noted, the first dimension of diversity is categorical and is typically a set of discrete classifications within a given distribution. The second dimension is the allocation of the elements to the categories. Conceptually, then, diversity becomes an interaction of the number of categories with the assignment of elements to those categories. Mathematically, interest is in the flatness of the distribution (Pielou 1975).

When considering the diversity of the media agenda, there are at least three different uses of diversity: source diversity, content diversity, and audience exposure diversity (Napoli 1999). Source diversity can mean both the number of media owners and the number of media channels. Content diversity refers to the category designations given to different program formats, issue categories, people’s demographic features, and viewpoints represented within the media. Audience exposure diversity refers to the content diversity that audiences are really exposed to in their media use. Media agenda diversity is an important measure over time because it can influence public opinion diversity and fundamental values of democracy.

In this study, content diversity is measured with subject content (issue categories) that the newspaper reports on, which is also called media agenda diversity. ","Teachman (1980);McDonald and Dimmick 2003;Junge (1994); Pielou 1975; Napoli 1999",NA,NA,"issue diversity",NA,NA

Diversity of outlets requires that space be allocated to users on different communication platforms to ensure that the general public is able to receive a diverse range of broadcasting services.36 In order to promote diversity of outlets, it is recommended that there should be at least three categories of broadcasting services: commercial; commu- nity, and public service.37 Although the programming format of these broadcast- ers is not mutually exclusive, their operating rationale is different. Thus, where all the three types of broadcasters are in operation, this will maximize the promo- tion of dissemination of a wide range of information and ideas catering for the informational needs of a diverse audience.

The second facet of diversity, which relates to sources, demands that adequate measures be put in place to prevent monopolies in the media.47 The protection of freedom of expression under international law obligates states to prevent undue media dominance or concentration by privately controlled media groups in monopolistic situations that may be harmful to a diversity of sources and views.4

The guarantee of freedom of expression imposes an obligation on the state to take steps to promote diversity of media content.61 Programming by broadcast- ers should provide diverse views, opinions, and perceptions to the public they serve. There are various measures that a state may put in place to promote diver- sity of content. These measures include, among others, strong support for both public service and community broadcasters, imposing content obligations on broadcasters, and requirements that programming of a broadcaster must con- tain independent productions.","T Mendel & E Salomon, Freedom of Expression and Broadcasting Regulation (Rio de Janeiro: UNESCO, 2011) at p.16.","diversity of sources","diversity of content","","diversity of outlets",""

These researchers proposed that media diversity measurement should incorporate two dimensions (Junge, 1994; D. G. McDonald & Dimmick, 2003; G. M. McDonald & Lin, 2004). The first dimension is the number of categories, and the second is the proportion of objects distributed to these categories. Thus, for example, in a study of newspaper content diversity, a set of discrete classifications of news content is the categorical dimension, whereas the second dimension is the percentages of each classification.
D. G. McDonald and Dimmick (2003) and G. M. McDonald and Lin (2004) proposed that measurement of media diversity should consider the interaction of these two dimensions. These researchers support a more appropriate statistical test that advances beyond descriptive studies of diversity. They pointed out that the measure of diversity (a) should vary between 0 and 1.00 (0 indicates no diversity and 1.00 indicates the highest degree of diversity), (b) should consider the condition where no population members are assigned to additional categories (in such case, the value of diversity should not be changed.), and (c) should be able to partition variance within the measures to assess contributions of other variables to diversity or statistical differences (G.

Consider the notion of cultural diversity, a well-established manifestation of the diversity principle in the communications sector (UNESCO, 1995, 2002). According to UNESCO (1995), cultural diversity is defined as
the manifold ways in which the cultures of groups and societies find expression. . . . Cultural diversity is made manifest not only through the varied ways in which the cultural heritage of humanity is expressed, augmented, and transmitted through the variety of cultural expressions, but also through diverse modes of artistic creation, production, dissemination, distribution and enjoyment, whatever the means and technologies used.

This concern about “national diversity” (i.e., the extent to which a multitude of national cultures remain vibrant and resistant to submersion beneath a few dominant cultures; see Norris & Engelhart, 2008) is persistent—and perhaps even intensified—given the greater challenges to limiting the cross-border flows of content that characterize the contemporary media environment.

However, two subconcepts of diversity, that of access and choice for the audience, are the two notions that have been placed high on the agenda of regulators and policymakers when considering media concentrations. Regarding diversity of access, the key question is whether the possibility of establishing new media companies leads to the situation where all legitimate interests in a given society have an equal (or proportional) share of access to media channels. Regarding diversity as choice, the key question is whether an increase in channels actually leads to greater choice for the audience.

Since the market model encourages the proliferation of channels and new audience markets, it can lead to increased numerical diversity, that is, more channels and theoretically more consumer choice.

Diversity concerns have economic moti- vations, as well, since policymakers have sought to maximize the choices available to media consumers, thereby increasing their overall satisfaction (Entman & Wildman, 1992; Napoli, 1999b).

For the ""marketplace of ideas"" to enhance citizen knowledge and the consideration of diverse viewpoints, citizens must be exposed to diverse points of view (Napoli, 1999a).

It might seem that all things plural, diverse and open-ended are to be automatically regarded as good. But as McLennan (1995) has pointed out, in deconstructing it, we are faced with questions of the following order: Is there not a point at which healthy diversity turns into unhealthy dissonance?

Similarly, while media diversity clearly denotes heterogeneity on some level, it can be defined in any number of ways and it can refer to any aspect of the media: sources, outlets, opinions as well as genres and representations. In debates on media policy, di- versity can refer to the extent which media contents reflect and serve various interests and opinions of the public, or it can refer to the general diffusion of media power in society on the level of ownership, economic structures, and political influence. Consid- ering the variety in possible definitions of diversity, empirical evidence on the relations of different aspects of diversity tends to be very ambiguous too

As Van Cuilenburg (1998) puts it, media diversity al- ways has to be ’gauged’ in some way to the variations in social reality. The question arises then, how to conceptualize this relationship. How are the differences against which diversity is examined constructed, institutionalized and operationalized?
Here, most studies follow McQuail’s (1992: 144-145) conceptualization, in which the media is seen to contribute to diversity in three ways: (1) by reflecting existing differ- ences in society, (2) by giving equal access to any different points of view, or (3) by offering a wide range of choice for individuals. Each of these implies a different inter- pretation on the meaning of media diversity and the standard by which it should be as- sessed.

Van Cuilenburg (1998: 41) has presented some of these problems in ‘diversity paradoxes’, contradictions between the aspects of diversity that cannot be reconciled. For instance, more reflective diversity usually goes with less diversity in terms of equal access for all groups. Similarly, the explosion of information increases choice but also bring along waste and overload of information. Even though the expansion of channels might lead to increased choice, there is no cor- responding effect on the citizens’ access to relevant information. On the contrary, in- crease in the diversity of supply may reduce the actual consumption of diversity (expo- sure diversity) (Gibbons, 2000: 308-311; Van der Wurff, 2004: 216).

In any case, the interpretation of diversity in terms of programme types or genres has consequently become the common focus of both scholarly and policy debates on media diversity (van der Wurff 2004: 216).","McLennan (1995); Van Cuilenburg (1998); McQuail (1992); Gibbons, 2000; Van der Wurff, 2004","","diversity of opinions","programme-type diversity","structural diversity/diversity of ownership/outlets",""

At the same time, it is not possible to determine an ideal score of perfect pluralism. As pluralism is not a value in itself (‘the more, the merrier’), it is restricted to (what is deemed to be) legitimate ideas presented in an accepted manner with reasonable arguments.

In this context, Valcke, Picard and Sükösd (2015) dif- ferentiate between external pluralism, the plurality of media outlets and media ownership, and internal plu- ralism, the plurality of opinions in actual reporting.

Political pluralism, which is about the need, in the interests of democracy, for a wide range of political opinions and viewpoints to be represented in the media. Democracy would be threatened if any single voice within the media, with the power to propagate a single political viewpoint, were to become too dominant. Cultural pluralism, which is about the need for a variety of cultures, as reflects the diversity within society, to find expression in the media. (Council of Europe, 1999, para. 4)

In media policy, the idea of pluralism is often used interchangeably with notions such as “diversity,” “plurality of information” and “multiplicity of voices.”

Typically, diversity of source implies that content will be provided by a number of separate organizations—that is, external pluralism, also described as “structural pluralism” (Council of Europe, 1999, para. 3)

What is notable about these varying responses to the fact of pluralism is this: They all suppose that the foundations for a stable political order depend on the different parties engaging with each other, whether to agree common ground, or—in the spirit of Locke’s arguments for toleration—to trade their values or interests for the sake of reaching a practical accommodation.

By contrast to such active conceptions of pluralism, as suggested, the response adopted in media policy is essentially nominal and passive, being content to make provision for the mere presence of differing perspectives in the public domain

Such “active pluralism” would require the deployment of measures that encourage conversation, dialogue, and understanding engagement between different strands of opinion and identity.

This means that the focus of measures for active pluralism would also tend to be on internal pluralism—that is, the variety of material offered by a single media organization, since it is within such an organization that the relationship between different kinds of content can be managed","Council of Europe, 1999","","political pluralism","","",""

Second, I argue that, even if pluralism did have its current normative value thanks to legal or constitutional decisions, other alternative values which have also been used to regulate journalism and public service broadcasting were given equal or greater emphasis by these same decisions. Third, I argue that whilst there is widespread agreement amongst politicians that pluralism is valuable, there is great conceptual confusion about the requirements of the term.

External pluralism is a situation in which social and political diversity is not reflected across every media outlet. Under this scenario, every media outlet misses out on the representation of different cultural groups and divergent political or ideological opinions and viewpoints. Yet, diversity is supposed to be found within all outlets, due to the diversity of suppliers and/or media owners (Doyle 2002, 12). ","Hallin and Manchini, 2004",NA,NA,NA,NA,"internal, external"
"163","005975@2013.nl","plu","Pluralism guarantees that citizens have free access to information that represents all points of view and, consequently, allows them to develop an independent opinion. For this purpose, there are two types of pluralism which, a priori, guarantee the freedom of information: internal and external pluralism. External pluralism refers to the diversity of media organisations and the contents that express the different points of view of a society. This means that pluralism emerges from the variety of companies (public or private), media (printed, broadcast, digital, etc.) and contents that express different editorial lines. On the other hand, internal pluralism occurs within each media organisation, and refers to the diversity of points of view that are included in the news content of each media organisation and reflect the search for neutrality, content balance, and cultural diversity.

A conceptual contribution to the definition of both types of pluralism was made by the Council of Europe (1994) in its fourth European Ministerial Conference on mass communication policy in a democratic society: “Pluralism can be internal, across a wide range of values, opinions, news stories and interests that find a vehicle of expression in the bosom of a particular media sector, or external through some of these bodies, each of them expressing a particular point of view”.","Hallin and Manchini, 2004; Council of Europe (1994)",NA,"Perspectives",NA,NA,NA

Indeed, studies in political communication generally find diverse sets of voices represented in the news*within a single news outlet (i.e., internal pluralism) as well as across a number of outlets (i.e., external pluralism)*in democracies where the press remains free from state control (Baum and Groeling, 2008)

Specifically, diversity in the news is maintained both internally and externally. Internal pluralism is defined as pluralism achieved within each media organization, where media outlets maintain neutrality, and avoid strong institutional ties to both social and political groups. By contrast, external pluralism is defined as ‘pluralism achieved at the level of the media system as a whole, through the existence of a range of media outlets or organizations reflecting viewpoints of different groups or tendencies in society’ (Hallin and Mancini, 2004: 29).","Baum and Groeling, 2008; Hallin and Mancini, 2004","plurality of viewpoints",NA,NA,NA,NA

In the media studies literature, the concept of pluralism has primarily been used in a dichotomous sense. Although the concept of media pluralism can be treated on various levels and is also interpreted through many dichotomies or alternatives, the fundamental distinction on which all others are based is between external and internal pluralism. According to Gibbons (1998: 31), external pluralism refers to the ‘diversity of media sources’, whereas for Hallin and Mancini (2004: 29), external pluralism is the kind ‘achieved at the level of the media systems as a whole, through the existence of a range of media out- lets or organizations reflecting the points of view of different groups and tendencies in society’. Klimkiewicz, however, claims that Hallin and Mancini’s definition of external pluralism might better suit the concept of structural media pluralism, given that ‘[t]he external/internal dichotomy has been drawn from the perspective of a single media orga- nization, not the media system as a whole’ (Klimkiewicz, 2010: 907).
Internal pluralism pertains to the level of the ‘diversity of media contents available to the public’ (Klimikiewicz, 2009: 46) or to the ‘pluralism achieved within each individual media outlet or organization’ (Hallin and Mancini, 2004: 29). There is greater consensus regarding the level at which internal pluralism occurs. 

in Doyle’s view, internal pluralism pertains to the diversity of the output (referring to the media content), whereas external pluralism refers to the diversification of media ownership (Doyle, 2002).","Gibbons (1998; Hallin and Mancini (2004;(Klimkiewicz, 2010);Doyle, 2002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Citing Doyle (2002: 11), once again, ‘pluralism is generally associated with diversity in the media; the presence of a number of different and independent voices, and of differing political opinions and representations of culture within the media’. There are two types of pluralism: external or structural pluralism and internal pluralism. External pluralism relates to the diversity of ownership within a specific market. It is achieved when there is a plurality of broadcasters and outlets in a sector. Internal pluralism refers to the diversity of output. It is achieved when extensive coverage and diversity of programming are provided by media outlets. Restrictions on media ownership are not sufficient in themselves to guarantee diversity of output reflecting different political and social views, and other policy instruments should be used to encourage greater internal pluralism (i.e. strong and independent media regulators) (Doyle 2002: 12; Venice Commission 2005: 11).","Doyle (2002)","","","","",""

When we asked people to explain what the word meant to them (see Makri & Blandford, 2012), we found that serendipitous experiences involved three ‘essential ingredients’: unexpected circumstances (the ‘accident’), an insightful ‘aha’ moment (the ‘sagacity’) and a valuable or potentially valuable outcome (the ‘happy’). This outcome must also be unanticipated as “no discovery of a thing you are looking for comes under this description [Walpole’s emphasis]” (Merton & Barber, 2004, p. 2).

We therefore define ‘coming across information serendipitously’ as ‘finding useful or potentially useful information unexpectedly – either when not looking for information at all, when looking for information about something else or when looking for information with no particular aim in mind.’ ","Merton & Barber, 2004; Makri & Blandford, 2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
