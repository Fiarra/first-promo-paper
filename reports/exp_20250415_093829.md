# Experiment Report: exp_20250415_093829

## Configuration
- Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
- Max Input Tokens: 2000
- Page Limit for Metadata: 4
- Extract Full Text: True

## Prompts Used
### Prompt File: title_abstract_prompts
### System Prompt

You are an expert in analyzing academic texts and extracting bibliographic information.
Your task is to accurately identify the title and abstract of scientific papers, 
and provide an assessment of your confidence in the extraction.


### User Prompt Template

You will receive text from a scientific paper, which contains a title and potentially an abstract.
Extract these fields from the text and provide a confidence score for each extraction.

Return ONLY valid JSON in the format below (and nothing else).
Do not include triple backticks, code blocks, or any additional markdown:

{{
  "title": "...",
  "abstract": "...",
  "confidence": {{
    "title_score": <number between 1-5>,
    "abstract_score": <number between 1-5>,
    "explanation": "Brief explanation of your confidence assessment"
  }},
  "debug_text": "First 50 chars of the text you're analyzing"
}}

Confidence Score Guidelines:
5: Extremely confident - Clearly identified with explicit section headers
4: Very confident - Strong evidence this is correct with clear structure
3: Moderately confident - Reasonable guess but some ambiguity
2: Low confidence - Significant uncertainty but made best guess
1: Very low confidence - Unable to reliably identify

If you cannot find a title or abstract, use "EXTRACTION_FAILED" as that field's value and provide an explanation in the confidence section.

Here is the text to analyze:
"""{text}"""
